The Raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,"
The Raven,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
The Raven,"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
The Raven,As of some one gently rapping—rapping at my chamber door.
The Raven,"""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door—"
The Raven,"Only this and nothing more."""
The Raven,"Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,"
The Raven,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
The Raven,Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
The Raven,From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
The Raven,For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
The Raven,Nameless here for evermore.
The Raven,And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
The Raven,Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
The Raven,"So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating"
The Raven,"""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—"
The Raven,Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
The Raven,"This it is and nothing more."""
The Raven,"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"
The Raven,"""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;"
The Raven,"But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,"
The Raven,"And so faintly you came tapping—tapping at my chamber door,"
The Raven,"That I scarce was sure I heard you""—here I opened wide the door:—"
The Raven,Darkness there and nothing more.
The Raven,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,"
The Raven,"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;"
The Raven,"But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,"
The Raven,"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!"""
The Raven,"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!"""
The Raven,Merely this and nothing more.
The Raven,"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
The Raven,"Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before."
The Raven,"""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;"
The Raven,"Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—"
The Raven,"Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;—"
The Raven,"'Tis the wind and nothing more."""
The Raven,"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,"
The Raven,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
The Raven,Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;
The Raven,"But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-"
The Raven,Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
The Raven,"Perched, and sat, and nothing more."
The Raven,"Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,"
The Raven,"By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"
The Raven,"""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,"
The Raven,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
The Raven,"Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"""
The Raven,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
The Raven,Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
The Raven,For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
The Raven,Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
The Raven,"Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,"
The Raven,"With such name as ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only"
The Raven,"That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour."
The Raven,Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
The Raven,"Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before—"
The Raven,"On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."""
The Raven,"Then the bird said, ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
The Raven,"""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,"
The Raven,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
The Raven,Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
The Raven,Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
The Raven,"Of 'Never—nevermore.'"""
The Raven,"But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,"
The Raven,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
The Raven,"Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking"
The Raven,"Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—"
The Raven,"What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore"
The Raven,"Meant in croaking ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
The Raven,To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
The Raven,"This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
The Raven,"On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,"
The Raven,"But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er, She shall press, ah, nevermore!"
The Raven,"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
The Raven,Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
The Raven,"""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee"
The Raven,Respite—respite and nepenthé from thy memories of Lenore!
The Raven,"Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthé, and forget this lost Lenore!"""
The Raven,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—"
The Raven,"Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,"
The Raven,"Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—"
The Raven,"On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—"
The Raven,"Is there— is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!"""
The Raven,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!"
The Raven,By that Heaven that bends above us — by that God we both adore—
The Raven,"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,"
The Raven,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore —
The Raven,"Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."""
The Raven,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting—"
The Raven,"""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!"
The Raven,Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
The Raven,Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
The Raven,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"""
The Raven,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
The Raven,"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting"
The Raven,On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
The Raven,"And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,"
The Raven,And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
The Raven,And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
The Raven,"Shall be lifted—nevermore! Published, 1845. Note Contents"

Ulalume,"It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,"
Ulalume,In the misty mid region of Weir—
Ulalume,"It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,"
Ulalume,In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.
Ulalume,"Here once, through an alley Titanic."
Ulalume,"Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul—"

Ulalume,In the realms of the boreal pole.
Ulalume,"Our talk had been serious and sober,"

To Helen,I saw thee once—once only—years ago:
To Helen,I must not say how many—but not many.
To Helen,It was a July midnight; and from out
To Helen,"A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,"
To Helen,"Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,"
To Helen,"There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,"
To Helen,"With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,"
To Helen,Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand
To Helen,"Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,"
To Helen,"Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe—"
To Helen,Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
To Helen,"That gave out, in return for the love-light,"
To Helen,Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death—
To Helen,Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
To Helen,"That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted"
To Helen,"By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence."
To Helen,"Clad all in white, upon a violet bank"
To Helen,I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon
To Helen,"Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,"
To Helen,"And on thine own, upturn'd—alas, in sorrow!"
To Helen,"Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight—"
To Helen,"Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),"
To Helen,"That bade me pause before that garden-gate,"
To Helen,To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
To Helen,"No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,"
To Helen,Save only thee and me—(O Heaven!—O God!
To Helen,How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)—
To Helen,Save only thee and me. I paused—I looked—
To Helen,And in an instant all things disappeared.
To Helen,"(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)"
To Helen,The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
To Helen,"The mossy banks and the meandering paths,"
To Helen,"The happy flowers and the repining trees,"
To Helen,Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
To Helen,Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
To Helen,All—all expired save thee—save less than thou:
To Helen,Save only the divine light in thine eyes—
To Helen,Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
To Helen,I saw but them—they were the world to me.
To Helen,I saw but them—saw only them for hours—
To Helen,Saw only them until the moon went down.
To Helen,What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten
To Helen,"Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!"
To Helen,How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!
To Helen,How silently serene a sea of pride!
To Helen,How daring an ambition! yet how deep—
To Helen,How fathomless a capacity for love!
To Helen,"But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,"
To Helen,Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
To Helen,"And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees"
To Helen,Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained. They would not go—they never yet have gone.
To Helen,"Lighting my lonely pathway home that night, They have not left me (as my hopes have) since."
To Helen,They follow me—they lead me through the years.
To Helen,They are my ministers—yet I their slave.
To Helen,Their office is to illumine and enkindle—
To Helen,"My duty, to be saved by their bright light,"
To Helen,"And purified in their electric fire,"
To Helen,And sanctified in their elysian fire.
To Helen,"They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),"
To Helen,And are far up in Heaven—the stars I kneel to
To Helen,"In the sad, silent watches of my night;"
To Helen,While even in the meridian glare of day
To Helen,I see them still—two sweetly scintillant
To Helen,"Venuses, unextinguished by the sun! 1846 Note Contents"

Al Aaraf1,I O! nothing earthly save the ray
Al Aaraf1,"(Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,"
Al Aaraf1,As in those gardens where the day
Al Aaraf1,Springs from the gems of Circassy—
Al Aaraf1,O! nothing earthly save the thrill
Al Aaraf1,Of melody in woodland rill—
Al Aaraf1,Or (music of the passion-hearted)
Al Aaraf1,Joy's voice so peacefully departed
Al Aaraf1,"That like the murmur in the shell,"
Al Aaraf1,Its echo dwelleth and will dwell—
Al Aaraf1,O! nothing of the dross of ours—
Al Aaraf1,Yet all the beauty—all the flowers
Al Aaraf1,"That list our Love, and deck our bowers—"
Al Aaraf1,"Adorn yon world afar, afar—"
Al Aaraf1,The wandering star.
Al Aaraf1,'Twas a sweet time for Nesace—for there
Al Aaraf1,"Her world lay lolling on the golden air,"
Al Aaraf1,Near four bright suns—a temporary rest—
Al Aaraf1,An oasis in desert of the blest.
Al Aaraf1,Away away—'mid seas of rays that roll
Al Aaraf1,Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul—
Al Aaraf1,The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
Al Aaraf1,Can struggle to its destin'd eminence—
Al Aaraf1,"To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,"
Al Aaraf1,"And late to ours, the favour'd one of God—"
Al Aaraf1,"But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,"
Al Aaraf1,"She throws aside the sceptre—leaves the helm,"
Al Aaraf1,"And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,"
Al Aaraf1,Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.
Al Aaraf1,"Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,"
Al Aaraf1,"Whence sprang the ""Idea of Beauty"" into birth,"
Al Aaraf1,"(Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,"
Al Aaraf1,"Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,"
Al Aaraf1,"It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt),"
Al Aaraf1,She look'd into Infinity—and knelt.
Al Aaraf1,"Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled—"
Al Aaraf1,Fit emblems of the model of her world—
Al Aaraf1,Seen but in beauty—not impeding sight—
Al Aaraf1,Of other beauty glittering thro' the light—
Al Aaraf1,"A wreath that twined each starry form around,"
Al Aaraf1,And all the opal'd air in color bound.
Al Aaraf1,All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Al Aaraf1,"Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head On the fair Capo Deucato 2 , and sprang"
Al Aaraf1,So eagerly around about to hang
Al Aaraf1,Upon the flying footsteps of—deep pride— Of her who lov'd a mortal—and so died 3 .
Al Aaraf1,"The Sephalica, budding with young bees,"
Al Aaraf1,"Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees: And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd 4 —"
Al Aaraf1,"Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd"
Al Aaraf1,All other loveliness: its honied dew
Al Aaraf1,(The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
Al Aaraf1,"Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,"
Al Aaraf1,And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
Al Aaraf1,In Trebizond—and on a sunny flower
Al Aaraf1,"So like its own above that, to this hour,"
Al Aaraf1,"It still remaineth, torturing the bee"
Al Aaraf1,"With madness, and unwonted reverie:"
Al Aaraf1,"In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf"
Al Aaraf1,"And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief"
Al Aaraf1,"Disconsolate linger—grief that hangs her head,"
Al Aaraf1,"Repenting follies that full long have fled,"
Al Aaraf1,"Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,"
Al Aaraf1,"Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair:"
Al Aaraf1,"Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light"
Al Aaraf1,"She fears to perfume, perfuming the night: And Clytia 5 pondering between many a sun,"
Al Aaraf1,While pettish tears adown her petals run: And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth 6 —
Al Aaraf1,"And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,"
Al Aaraf1,Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Al Aaraf1,"Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king: And Valisnerian lotus thither flown 7 From struggling with the waters of the Rhone: And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante 8 !"
Al Aaraf1,Isola d'oro!—Fior di Levante! And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever 9 With Indian Cupid down the holy river—
Al Aaraf1,"Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given"
Al Aaraf1,"To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven: 10 ""Spirit! that dwellest where,"

Al Aaraf1,"From their pride, and from their throne"
Al Aaraf1,To be drudges till the last—
Al Aaraf1,To be carriers of fire
Al Aaraf1,(The red fire of their heart)
Al Aaraf1,With speed that may not tire
Al Aaraf1,And with pain that shall not part—
Al Aaraf1,Who livest— that we know—
Al Aaraf1,In Eternity—we feel—
Al Aaraf1,But the shadow of whose brow
Al Aaraf1,What spirit shall reveal?
Al Aaraf1,"Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,"
Al Aaraf1,Thy messenger hath known
Al Aaraf1,Have dream'd for thy Infinity
Al Aaraf1,A model of their own 11 —
Al Aaraf1,"Thy will is done, O God!"
Al Aaraf1,The star hath ridden high
Al Aaraf1,"Thro' many a tempest, but she rode"
Al Aaraf1,Beneath thy burning eye;
Al Aaraf1,"And here, in thought, to thee—"
Al Aaraf1,In thought that can alone
Al Aaraf1,Ascend thy empire and so be
Al Aaraf1,A partner of thy throne—
Al Aaraf1,"By winged Fantasy 12 ,"
Al Aaraf1,"My embassy is given,"
Al Aaraf1,Till secrecy shall knowledge be
Al Aaraf1,In the environs of Heaven.
Al Aaraf1,She ceas'd—and buried then her burning cheek
Al Aaraf1,"Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek"
Al Aaraf1,A shelter from the fervor of His eye;
Al Aaraf1,For the stars trembled at the Deity.
Al Aaraf1,She stirr'd not—breath'd not—for a voice was there
Al Aaraf1,How solemnly pervading the calm air!
Al Aaraf1,A sound of silence on the startled ear
Al Aaraf1,"Which dreamy poets name ""the music of the sphere."""
Al Aaraf1,Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
Al Aaraf1,"""Silence""—which is the merest word of all."
Al Aaraf1,"All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things"
Al Aaraf1,Flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings—
Al Aaraf1,"But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high"
Al Aaraf1,"The eternal voice of God is passing by,"
Al Aaraf1,And the red winds are withering in the sky!
Al Aaraf1,""" What tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run 13 ,"
Al Aaraf1,"Link'd to a little system, and one sun—"
Al Aaraf1,"Where all my love is folly, and the crowd"
Al Aaraf1,"Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,"
Al Aaraf1,"The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath"
Al Aaraf1,(Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
Al Aaraf1,What tho' in worlds which own a single sun
Al Aaraf1,"The sands of time grow dimmer as they run,"
Al Aaraf1,"Yet thine is my resplendency, so given"
Al Aaraf1,To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven.
Al Aaraf1,"Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,"
Al Aaraf1,"With all thy train, athwart the moony sky— Apart —like fire-flies in Sicilian night 14 ,"
Al Aaraf1,And wing to other worlds another light!
Al Aaraf1,Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
Al Aaraf1,To the proud orbs that twinkle—and so be
Al Aaraf1,To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban

Al Aaraf1,"Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,"
Al Aaraf1,The single-mooned eve!-on earth we plight
Al Aaraf1,Our faith to one love—and one moon adore—
Al Aaraf1,The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
Al Aaraf1,"As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,"
Al Aaraf1,"Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,"
Al Aaraf1,And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain
Al Aaraf1,Her way —but left not yet her Therasæan reign 15 . II High on a mountain of enamell'd head—
Al Aaraf1,Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Al Aaraf1,"Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,"
Al Aaraf1,"Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees"
Al Aaraf1,"With many a mutter'd ""hope to be forgiven"""
Al Aaraf1,What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven—
Al Aaraf1,"Of rosy head, that towering far away"
Al Aaraf1,"Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray"
Al Aaraf1,"Of sunken suns at eve—at noon of night,"
Al Aaraf1,While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light—
Al Aaraf1,Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
Al Aaraf1,"Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,"
Al Aaraf1,Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
Al Aaraf1,"Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,"
Al Aaraf1,And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
Al Aaraf1,"Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall 16 Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall"
Al Aaraf1,"Of their own dissolution, while they die—"
Al Aaraf1,Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
Al Aaraf1,"A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,"
Al Aaraf1,Sat gently on these columns as a crown—
Al Aaraf1,"A window of one circular diamond, there,"
Al Aaraf1,Look'd out above into the purple air
Al Aaraf1,And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
Al Aaraf1,"And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,"
Al Aaraf1,"Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,"
Al Aaraf1,Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.
Al Aaraf1,But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
Al Aaraf1,The dimness of this world: that grayish green
Al Aaraf1,That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave
Al Aaraf1,"Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave—"
Al Aaraf1,And every sculptured cherub thereabout
Al Aaraf1,"That from his marble dwelling peered out,"
Al Aaraf1,Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche—
Al Aaraf1,Achaian statues in a world so rich? Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis 17 —
Al Aaraf1,"From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss"
Al Aaraf1,"Of beautiful Gomorrah! Oh, the wave 18 Is now upon thee—but too late to save!"
Al Aaraf1,Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
Al Aaraf1,"Witness the murmur of the gray twilight That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco 19 ,"
Al Aaraf1,Of many a wild star-gazer long ago—
Al Aaraf1,That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Al Aaraf1,"Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,"
Al Aaraf1,And sees the darkness coming as a cloud—
Al Aaraf1,Is not its form—its voice—most palpable and loud? 20 But what is this?—it cometh—and it brings
Al Aaraf1,A music with it—'tis the rush of wings—
Al Aaraf1,"A pause—and then a sweeping, falling strain,"
Al Aaraf1,And Nesace is in her halls again.
Al Aaraf1,From the wild energy of wanton haste
Al Aaraf1,"Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;"
Al Aaraf1,The zone that clung around her gentle waist
Al Aaraf1,Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
Al Aaraf1,Within the centre of that hall to breathe
Al Aaraf1,"She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,"
Al Aaraf1,The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
Al Aaraf1,"And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there! Young flowers were whispering in melody 21 To happy flowers that night—and tree to tree;"
Al Aaraf1,Fountains were gushing music as they fell
Al Aaraf1,"In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;"
Al Aaraf1,Yet silence came upon material things—
Al Aaraf1,"Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings—"
Al Aaraf1,And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Al Aaraf1,Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:
Al Aaraf1,"""Neath blue-bell or streamer—"
Al Aaraf1,Or tufted wild spray
Al Aaraf1,"That keeps, from the dreamer, The moonbeam away— 22 Bright beings! that ponder,"
Al Aaraf1,"With half-closing eyes,"
Al Aaraf1,On the stars which your wonder
Al Aaraf1,"Hath drawn from the skies,"
Al Aaraf1,"Till they glance thro' the shade, and"
Al Aaraf1,Come down to your brow
Al Aaraf1,Like—eyes of the maiden
Al Aaraf1,Who calls on you now—
Al Aaraf1,Arise! from your dreaming
Al Aaraf1,"In violet bowers,"
Al Aaraf1,To duty beseeming
Al Aaraf1,These star-litten hours—
Al Aaraf1,And shake from your tresses
Al Aaraf1,Encumber'd with dew
Al Aaraf1,The breath of those kisses
Al Aaraf1,That cumber them too—
Al Aaraf1,"(O! how, without you, Love!"
Al Aaraf1,Could angels be blest?)
Al Aaraf1,Those kisses of true love
Al Aaraf1,That lull'd ye to rest!
Al Aaraf1,Up! shake from your wing
Al Aaraf1,Each hindering thing:
Al Aaraf1,The dew of the night—
Al Aaraf1,It would weigh down your flight;
Al Aaraf1,And true love caresses—
Al Aaraf1,O! leave them apart!
Al Aaraf1,"They are light on the tresses,"
Al Aaraf1,But lead on the heart.
Al Aaraf1,Ligeia! Ligeia!
Al Aaraf1,My beautiful one!
Al Aaraf1,Whose harshest idea
Al Aaraf1,"Will to melody run,"
Al Aaraf1,O! is it thy will
Al Aaraf1,On the breezes to toss?
Al Aaraf1,"Or, capriciously still, Like the lone Albatross, 23 Incumbent on night"
Al Aaraf1,(As she on the air)
Al Aaraf1,To keep watch with delight
Al Aaraf1,On the harmony there?
Al Aaraf1,Ligeia! wherever
Al Aaraf1,"Thy image may be,"
Al Aaraf1,No magic shall sever
Al Aaraf1,Thy music from thee.
Al Aaraf1,Thou hast bound many eyes
Al Aaraf1,In a dreamy sleep—
Al Aaraf1,But the strains still arise
Al Aaraf1,Which thy vigilance keep—
Al Aaraf1,The sound of the rain
Al Aaraf1,"Which leaps down to the flower,"
Al Aaraf1,And dances again
Al Aaraf1,In the rhythm of the shower— The murmur that springs 24 From the growing of grass
Al Aaraf1,Are the music of things—
Al Aaraf1,"But are modell'd, alas!"
Al Aaraf1,"Away, then, my dearest,"
Al Aaraf1,O! hie thee away
Al Aaraf1,To springs that lie clearest
Al Aaraf1,Beneath the moon-ray—
Al Aaraf1,"To lone lake that smiles,"
Al Aaraf1,"In its dream of deep rest,"
Al Aaraf1,At the many star-isles
Al Aaraf1,That enjewel its breast—
Al Aaraf1,"Where wild flowers, creeping,"
Al Aaraf1,"Have mingled their shade,"
Al Aaraf1,On its margin is sleeping
Al Aaraf1,Full many a maid—
Al Aaraf1,"Some have left the cool glade, and Have slept with the bee— 25 Arouse them, my maiden,"

Al Aaraf1,As the spell which no slumber
Al Aaraf1,"Of witchery may test,"

Al Aaraf1,"Which lull'd him to rest?"""
Al Aaraf1,"Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,"
Al Aaraf1,"A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',"
Al Aaraf1,Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight—
Al Aaraf1,"Seraphs in all but ""Knowledge,"" the keen light"
Al Aaraf1,"That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds afar,"
Al Aaraf1,O death! from eye of God upon that star;
Al Aaraf1,Sweet was that error—sweeter still that death—
Al Aaraf1,Sweet was that error—ev'n with us the breath
Al Aaraf1,Of Science dims the mirror of our joy—
Al Aaraf1,"To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy—"
Al Aaraf1,For what (to them) availeth it to know
Al Aaraf1,That Truth is Falsehood—or that Bliss is Woe?
Al Aaraf1,Sweet was their death—with them to die was rife
Al Aaraf1,With the last ecstasy of satiate life—
Al Aaraf1,Beyond that death no immortality—
Al Aaraf1,"But sleep that pondereth and is not ""to be""—"
Al Aaraf1,"And there—oh! may my weary spirit dwell— Apart from Heaven's Eternity—and yet how far from Hell! 26 What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim"
Al Aaraf1,Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
Al Aaraf1,But two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts
Al Aaraf1,To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
Al Aaraf1,A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover—
Al Aaraf1,O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
Al Aaraf1,"Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known? Unguided Love hath fallen—'mid ""tears of perfect moan."" 27 He was a goodly spirit—he who fell:"
Al Aaraf1,A wanderer by mossy-mantled well—
Al Aaraf1,A gazer on the lights that shine above—
Al Aaraf1,A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
Al Aaraf1,"What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,"
Al Aaraf1,And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair—
Al Aaraf1,"And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy"
Al Aaraf1,To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
Al Aaraf1,The night had found (to him a night of wo)
Al Aaraf1,"Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo—"
Al Aaraf1,"Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,"
Al Aaraf1,And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
Al Aaraf1,Here sate he with his love—his dark eye bent
Al Aaraf1,With eagle gaze along the firmament:
Al Aaraf1,Now turn'd it upon her—but ever then
Al Aaraf1,It trembled to the orb of Earth again.
Al Aaraf1,"""Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!"
Al Aaraf1,How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
Al Aaraf1,She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
Al Aaraf1,"I left her gorgeous halls—nor mourned to leave,"
Al Aaraf1,That eve—that eve—I should remember well—
Al Aaraf1,"The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell"
Al Aaraf1,On th' Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Al Aaraf1,"Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall—"
Al Aaraf1,"And on my eyelids—O, the heavy light!"
Al Aaraf1,How drowsily it weighed them into night!
Al Aaraf1,"On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran"
Al Aaraf1,With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
Al Aaraf1,"But O, that light!—I slumbered—Death, the while,"
Al Aaraf1,Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
Al Aaraf1,So softly that no single silken hair
Al Aaraf1,Awoke that slept—or knew that he was there.
Al Aaraf1,"""The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon Was a proud temple called the Parthenon; 28 More beauty clung around her columned wall Then even thy glowing bosom beats withal, 29 And when old Time my wing did disenthral"
Al Aaraf1,"Thence sprang I—as the eagle from his tower,"
Al Aaraf1,And years I left behind me in an hour.
Al Aaraf1,"What time upon her airy bounds I hung,"
Al Aaraf1,One half the garden of her globe was flung
Al Aaraf1,Unrolling as a chart unto my view—
Al Aaraf1,Tenantless cities of the desert too!
Al Aaraf1,"Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,"
Al Aaraf1,"And half I wished to be again of men."""
Al Aaraf1,"""My Angelo! and why of them to be?"

Al Aaraf1,"And greener fields than in yon world above,"
Al Aaraf1,"And woman's loveliness—and passionate love."""
Al Aaraf1,"""But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft Failed , as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft, 30 Perhaps my brain grew dizzy—but the world"
Al Aaraf1,"I left so late was into chaos hurled,"
Al Aaraf1,"Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,"
Al Aaraf1,"And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart."
Al Aaraf1,"Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,"
Al Aaraf1,"And fell—not swiftly as I rose before,"
Al Aaraf1,"But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'"
Al Aaraf1,"Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!"
Al Aaraf1,"Nor long the measure of my falling hours,"

Al Aaraf1,Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod She grants to us as granted by her God—
Al Aaraf1,"But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled"
Al Aaraf1,Never his fairy wing o'er fairer world!
Al Aaraf1,"Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes"
Al Aaraf1,"Alone could see the phantom in the skies,"
Al Aaraf1,When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Al Aaraf1,Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea—
Al Aaraf1,"But when its glory swelled upon the sky,"
Al Aaraf1,"As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,"
Al Aaraf1,"We paused before the heritage of men,"
Al Aaraf1,"And thy star trembled—as doth Beauty then!"""
Al Aaraf1,"Thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away"

Tamerlane,Kind solace in a dying hour!
Tamerlane,"Such, father, is not (now) my theme—"
Tamerlane,I will not madly deem that power
Tamerlane,Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Tamerlane,Unearthly pride hath revelled in—
Tamerlane,I have no time to dote or dream:
Tamerlane,You call it hope—that fire of fire!
Tamerlane,It is but agony of desire:
Tamerlane,If I can hope—O God! I can—
Tamerlane,Its fount is holier—more divine—
Tamerlane,"I would not call thee fool, old man,"
Tamerlane,But such is not a gift of thine.
Tamerlane,Know thou the secret of a spirit
Tamerlane,Bowed from its wild pride into shame
Tamerlane,O yearning heart! I did inherit
Tamerlane,"Thy withering portion with the fame,"
Tamerlane,The searing glory which hath shone
Tamerlane,"Amid the Jewels of my throne,"
Tamerlane,Halo of Hell! and with a pain
Tamerlane,Not Hell shall make me fear again—
Tamerlane,"O craving heart, for the lost flowers"
Tamerlane,And sunshine of my summer hours!
Tamerlane,"The undying voice of that dead time,"
Tamerlane,"With its interminable chime,"
Tamerlane,"Rings, in the spirit of a spell,"
Tamerlane,Upon thy emptiness—a knell.
Tamerlane,I have not always been as now:
Tamerlane,The fevered diadem on my brow
Tamerlane,I claimed and won usurpingly—
Tamerlane,Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Tamerlane,Rome to the Cæsar—this to me?
Tamerlane,"The heritage of a kingly mind,"
Tamerlane,And a proud spirit which hath striven
Tamerlane,Triumphantly with human kind.
Tamerlane,On mountain soil I first drew life:
Tamerlane,The mists of the Taglay have shed
Tamerlane,"Nightly their dews upon my head,"
Tamerlane,"And, I believe, the winged strife"
Tamerlane,And tumult of the headlong air
Tamerlane,Have nestled in my very hair.
Tamerlane,So late from Heaven—that dew—it fell
Tamerlane,('Mid dreams of an unholy night)
Tamerlane,"Upon me with the touch of Hell,"
Tamerlane,While the red flashing of the light
Tamerlane,"From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,"
Tamerlane,Appeared to my half-closing eye
Tamerlane,The pageantry of monarchy;
Tamerlane,And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
Tamerlane,"Came hurriedly upon me, telling"
Tamerlane,"Of human battle, where my voice,"
Tamerlane,"My own voice, silly child!—was swelling"
Tamerlane,"(O! how my spirit would rejoice,"
Tamerlane,And leap within me at the cry)
Tamerlane,The battle-cry of Victory!
Tamerlane,The rain came down upon my head
Tamerlane,Unsheltered—and the heavy wind
Tamerlane,Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
Tamerlane,"It was but man, I thought, who shed"
Tamerlane,Laurels upon me: and the rush—
Tamerlane,The torrent of the chilly air
Tamerlane,Gurgled within my ear the crush
Tamerlane,Of empires—with the captive's prayer—
Tamerlane,The hum of suitors—and the tone
Tamerlane,Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.
Tamerlane,"My passions, from that hapless hour,"
Tamerlane,Usurped a tyranny which men
Tamerlane,"Have deemed since I have reached to power,"
Tamerlane,My innate nature—be it so:
Tamerlane,"But, father, there lived one who, then,"
Tamerlane,Then—in my boyhood—when their fire
Tamerlane,Burned with a still intenser glow
Tamerlane,"(For passion must, with youth, expire)"
Tamerlane,E'en then who knew this iron heart
Tamerlane,In woman's weakness had a part.
Tamerlane,I have no words—alas!—to tell
Tamerlane,The loveliness of loving well!
Tamerlane,Nor would I now attempt to trace
Tamerlane,The more than beauty of a face
Tamerlane,"Whose lineaments, upon my mind,"
Tamerlane,Are—shadows on th' unstable wind:
Tamerlane,Thus I remember having dwelt
Tamerlane,"Some page of early lore upon,"
Tamerlane,"With loitering eye, till I have felt"
Tamerlane,The letters—with their meaning—melt
Tamerlane,To fantasies—with none.
Tamerlane,"O, she was worthy of all love!"
Tamerlane,Love as in infancy was mine—
Tamerlane,'Twas such as angel minds above
Tamerlane,Might envy; her young heart the shrine
Tamerlane,On which my every hope and thought
Tamerlane,"Were incense—then a goodly gift,"
Tamerlane,For they were childish and upright—
Tamerlane,Pure—as her young example taught:
Tamerlane,"Why did I leave it, and, adrift,"
Tamerlane,"Trust to the fire within, for light?"
Tamerlane,We grew in age—and love—together—
Tamerlane,"Roaming the forest, and the wild;"
Tamerlane,My breast her shield in wintry weather—
Tamerlane,"And, when the friendly sunshine smiled."
Tamerlane,"And she would mark the opening skies, I saw no Heaven—but in her eyes."
Tamerlane,Young Love's first lesson is——the heart:
Tamerlane,"For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,"
Tamerlane,"When, from our little cares apart,"
Tamerlane,"And laughing at her girlish wiles,"
Tamerlane,"I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,"
Tamerlane,And pour my spirit out in tears—
Tamerlane,There was no need to speak the rest—
Tamerlane,No need to quiet any fears
Tamerlane,"Of her—who asked no reason why,"
Tamerlane,But turned on me her quiet eye!
Tamerlane,Yet more than worthy of the love
Tamerlane,"My spirit struggled with, and strove"
Tamerlane,"When, on the mountain peak, alone,"
Tamerlane,Ambition lent it a new tone—
Tamerlane,I had no being—but in thee:
Tamerlane,"The world, and all it did contain"
Tamerlane,In the earth—the air—the sea—
Tamerlane,Its joy—its little lot of pain
Tamerlane,"That was new pleasure—the ideal,"
Tamerlane,"Dim, vanities of dreams by night—"
Tamerlane,And dimmer nothings which were real—
Tamerlane,(Shadows—and a more shadowy light!)
Tamerlane,"Parted upon their misty wings,"
Tamerlane,"And, so, confusedly, became"
Tamerlane,Thine image and—a name—a name!
Tamerlane,Two separate—yet most intimate things.
Tamerlane,I was ambitious—have you known
Tamerlane,"The passion, father? You have not:"
Tamerlane,"A cottager, I marked a throne"
Tamerlane,"Of half the world as all my own,"
Tamerlane,And murmured at such lowly lot—
Tamerlane,"But, just like any other dream,"
Tamerlane,Upon the vapor of the dew
Tamerlane,"My own had past, did not the beam"
Tamerlane,Of beauty which did while it thro'
Tamerlane,The minute—the hour—the day—oppress
Tamerlane,My mind with double loveliness.
Tamerlane,We walked together on the crown
Tamerlane,Of a high mountain which looked down
Tamerlane,Afar from its proud natural towers
Tamerlane,"Of rock and forest, on the hills—"
Tamerlane,The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
Tamerlane,And shouting with a thousand rills.
Tamerlane,"I spoke to her of power and pride,"
Tamerlane,But mystically—in such guise
Tamerlane,That she might deem it nought beside
Tamerlane,The moment's converse; in her eyes
Tamerlane,"I read, perhaps too carelessly—"
Tamerlane,A mingled feeling with my own—
Tamerlane,"The flush on her bright cheek, to me"
Tamerlane,Seemed to become a queenly throne
Tamerlane,Too well that I should let it be
Tamerlane,Light in the wilderness alone.
Tamerlane,"I wrapped myself in grandeur then,"
Tamerlane,And donned a visionary crown—
Tamerlane,Yet it was not that Fantasy
Tamerlane,Had thrown her mantle over me—
Tamerlane,"But that, among the rabble—men,"
Tamerlane,Lion ambition is chained down—
Tamerlane,And crouches to a keeper's hand—
Tamerlane,Not so in deserts where the grand—
Tamerlane,The wild—the terrible conspire
Tamerlane,With their own breath to fan his fire.
Tamerlane,Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!—
Tamerlane,Is she not queen of Earth? her pride
Tamerlane,Above all cities? in her hand
Tamerlane,Their destinies? in all beside
Tamerlane,Of glory which the world hath known
Tamerlane,Stands she not nobly and alone?
Tamerlane,Falling—her veriest stepping-stone
Tamerlane,Shall form the pedestal of a throne—
Tamerlane,And who her sovereign? Timour—he
Tamerlane,Whom the astonished people saw
Tamerlane,Striding o'er empires haughtily
Tamerlane,A diademed outlaw!
Tamerlane,"O, human love! thou spirit given,"
Tamerlane,"On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!"
Tamerlane,Which fall'st into the soul like rain
Tamerlane,"Upon the Siroc-withered plain,"
Tamerlane,"And, failing in thy power to bless,"
Tamerlane,But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
Tamerlane,Idea! which bindest life around
Tamerlane,With music of so strange a sound
Tamerlane,And beauty of so wild a birth—
Tamerlane,Farewell! for I have won the Earth.
Tamerlane,"When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see"
Tamerlane,"No cliff beyond him in the sky,"
Tamerlane,His pinions were bent droopingly—
Tamerlane,And homeward turned his softened eye.
Tamerlane,'Twas sunset: When the sun will part
Tamerlane,There comes a sullenness of heart
Tamerlane,To him who still would look upon
Tamerlane,The glory of the summer sun.
Tamerlane,That soul will hate the ev'ning mist
Tamerlane,"So often lovely, and will list"
Tamerlane,To the sound of the coming darkness (known
Tamerlane,To those whose spirits hearken) as one
Tamerlane,"Who, in a dream of night, would fly,"
Tamerlane,"But cannot , from a danger nigh."
Tamerlane,What tho' the moon—tho' the white moon
Tamerlane,"Shed all the splendor of her noon, Her smile is chilly—and her beam,"
Tamerlane,"In that time of dreariness, will seem"
Tamerlane,(So like you gather in your breath)
Tamerlane,A portrait taken after death.
Tamerlane,And boyhood is a summer sun
Tamerlane,Whose waning is the dreariest one—
Tamerlane,"For all we live to know is known,"
Tamerlane,And all we seek to keep hath flown—
Tamerlane,"Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall"
Tamerlane,With the noon-day beauty—which is all.
Tamerlane,I reached my home—my home no more—
Tamerlane,For all had flown who made it so.
Tamerlane,"I passed from out its mossy door,"
Tamerlane,"And, tho' my tread was soft and low,"
Tamerlane,A voice came from the threshold stone
Tamerlane,Of one whom I had earlier known—
Tamerlane,"O, I defy thee, Hell, to show"
Tamerlane,"On beds of fire that burn below,"
Tamerlane,An humbler heart—a deeper woe.
Tamerlane,"Father, I firmly do believe—"
Tamerlane,I know —for Death who comes for me
Tamerlane,"From regions of the blest afar,"
Tamerlane,"Where there is nothing to deceive,"
Tamerlane,Hath left his iron gate ajar.
Tamerlane,And rays of truth you cannot see
Tamerlane,Are flashing thro' Eternity——
Tamerlane,I do believe that Eblis hath
Tamerlane,A snare in every human path—
Tamerlane,"Else how, when in the holy grove"
Tamerlane,"I wandered of the idol, Love,—"
Tamerlane,Who daily scents his snowy wings
Tamerlane,With incense of burnt-offerings
Tamerlane,"From the most unpolluted things,"
Tamerlane,Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Tamerlane,Above with trellised rays from Heaven
Tamerlane,No mote may shun—no tiniest fly—
Tamerlane,The light'ning of his eagle eye—
Tamerlane,"How was it that Ambition crept,"
Tamerlane,"Unseen, amid the revels there,"
Tamerlane,"Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt"
Tamerlane,In the tangles of Love's very hair! 1829. Note Contents p. 2

Romance,I have no time for idle cares
Romance,Though gazing on the unquiet sky.
Romance,And when an hour with calmer wings
Romance,Its down upon my spirit flings—
Romance,That little time with lyre and rhyme
Romance,To while away—forbidden things!
Romance,My heart would feel to be a crime
Romance,Unless it trembled with the strings. 1829 Contents p. 2
Fairyland,Dim vales—and shadowy floods—
Fairyland,"And cloudy-looking woods,"
Fairyland,Whose forms we can't discover
Fairyland,For the tears that drip all over
Fairyland,Huge moons there wax and wane—
Fairyland,Again—again—again—
Fairyland,Every moment of the night—
Fairyland,Forever changing places—
Fairyland,And they put out the star-light
Fairyland,With the breath from their pale faces.
Fairyland,About twelve by the moon-dial
Fairyland,One more filmy than the rest
Fairyland,"(A kind which, upon trial,"
Fairyland,They have found to be the best)
Fairyland,Comes down—still down—and down
Fairyland,With its centre on the crown
Fairyland,"Of a mountain's eminence,"
Fairyland,While its wide circumference
Fairyland,In easy drapery falls
Fairyland,"Over hamlets, over halls,"
Fairyland,Wherever they may be—
Fairyland,O'er the strange woods—o'er the sea—
Fairyland,Over spirits on the wing—
Fairyland,Over every drowsy thing—
Fairyland,And buries them up quite
Fairyland,In a labyrinth of light—
Fairyland,"And then, how deep!—O, deep!"
Fairyland,Is the passion of their sleep.
Fairyland,"In the morning they arise,"
Fairyland,And their moony covering
Fairyland,"Is soaring in the skies,"
Fairyland,"With the tempests as they toss,"
Fairyland,Like—almost any thing—
Fairyland,Or a yellow Albatross.
Fairyland,They use that moon no more
Fairyland,For the same end as before—
Fairyland,Videlicet a tent—
Fairyland,Which I think extravagant:
Fairyland,"Its atomies, however,"
Fairyland,"Into a shower dissever,"
Fairyland,"Of which those butterflies,"
Fairyland,"Of Earth, who seek the skies,"
Fairyland,And so come down again
Fairyland,(Never-contented thing!)
Fairyland,Have brought a specimen
Fairyland,Upon their quivering wings. 1831 Contents p. 2
The Lake,In spring of youth it was my lot
The Lake,To haunt of the wide world a spot
The Lake,The which I could not love the less—
The Lake,So lovely was the loneliness
The Lake,"Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,"
The Lake,And the tall pines that towered around.
The Lake,But when the Night had thrown her pall
The Lake,"Upon the spot, as upon all,"
The Lake,And the mystic wind went by
The Lake,Murmuring in melody—
The Lake,"Then—ah, then, I would awake"
The Lake,To the terror of the lone lake.
The Lake,"Yet that terror was not fright,"
The Lake,But a tremulous delight—
The Lake,A feeling not the jewelled mine
The Lake,Could teach or bribe me to define—
The Lake,Nor Love—although the Love were thine.
The Lake,"Death was in that poisonous wave,"
The Lake,And in its gulf a fitting grave
The Lake,For him who thence could solace bring
The Lake,To his lone imagining—
The Lake,Whose solitary soul could make
The Lake,An Eden of that dim lake. 1827 Contents p. 2
