# Poetry-AI

My aim was to create an ML model that could be trained on the poems of any specific author and generate poetry that sounds like their work. I planned to train the model on two of my favorite authors, Mary Oliver and Edgar Allen Poe, as their styles are very different and I was interested in seeing if the model was versatile enough to analyze both poets' writing.
