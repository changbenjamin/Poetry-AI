12F,"When loneliness comes stalking, go into the fields, consider"
12F,the orderliness of the world. Notice
12F,"something you have never noticed before,"
12F,like the tambourine sound of the snow-cricket
12F,whose pale green body is no longer than your thumb.
12F,"Stare hard at the hummingbird, in the summer rain,"
12F,shaking the water-sparks from its wings.
12F,"Let grief be your sister, she will whether or no."
12F,"Rise up from the stump of sorrow, and be green also,"
12F,like the diligent leaves.
12F,A lifetime isn’t long enough for the beauty of this world
12F,and the responsibilities of your life.
12F,"Scatter your flowers over the graves, and walk away."
12F,Be good-natured and untidy in your exuberance.
12F,"In the glare of your mind, be modest."
12F,"And beholden to what is tactile, and thrilling."
12F,"Live with the beetle, and the wind."
12F,This is the dark bread of the poem.
12F,This is the dark and nourishing bread of the poem.
1B,"I rose this morning early as usual, and went to my desk."
1B,"But it’s spring,"
1B,"and the thrush is in the woods,"
1B,"somewhere in the twirled branches, and he is singing."
1B,"And so, now, I am standing by the open door."
1B,And now I am stepping down onto the grass.
1B,I am touching a few leaves.
1B,I am noticing the way the yellow butterflies
1B,"move together, in a twinkling cloud, over the field."
1B,And I am thinking: maybe just looking and listening
1B,is the real work.
1B,"Maybe the world, without us,"
1B,is the real poem.
1G,Will the hungry ox stand in the field and not eat
1G,of the sweet grass?
1G,Will the owl bite off its own wings?
1G,Will the lark forget to lift its body in the air or
1G,forget to sing?
1G,Will the rivers run upstream?
1G,"Behold, I say—behold"
1G,the reliability and the finery and the teachings
1G,of this gritty earth gift.
2B,For how many years have you gone through the house
2B,"shutting the windows,"
2B,while the rain was still five miles away
2B,"and veering, o plum-colored clouds, to the north,"
2B,away from you
2B,and you did not even know enough
2B,"to be sorry,"
2B,you were glad
2B,"those silver sheets, with the occasional golden staple,"
2B,"were sweeping on, elsewhere,"
2B,violent and electric and uncontrollable—
2B,and will you find yourself finally wanting to forget
2B,"all enclosures, including"
2B,"the enclosure of yourself, o lonely leaf, and will you"
2B,"dash finally, frantically,"
2B,to the windows and haul them open and lean out
2B,"to the dark, silvered sky, to everything"
2B,"that is beyond capture, shouting"
2B,"I’m here, I’m here! Now, now, now, now, now."
3G,The witchery of living
3G,is my whole conversation
3G,"with you, my darlings."
3G,All I can tell you is what I know.
3G,"Look, and look again."
3G,This world is not just a little thrill for the eyes.
3G,It’s more than bones.
3G,It’s more than the delicate wrist with its personal pulse.
3G,It’s more than the beating of the single heart.
3G,It’s praising.
3G,It’s giving until the giving feels like receiving.
3G,You have a life—just imagine that!
3G,"You have this day, and maybe another, and maybe"
3G,still another.
5S,Two or three times in my life I discovered love.
5S,Each time it seemed to solve everything.
5S,Each time it solved a great many things
5S,but not everything.
5S,"Yet left me as grateful as if it had indeed, and"
5S,"thoroughly, solved everything."
6B,"Count the roses, red and fluttering."
6B,"Count the roses, wrinkled and salt."
6B,Each with its yellow lint at the center.
6B,Each with its honey pooled and ready.
6B,Do you have a question that can’t be answered?
6B,Do the stars frighten you by their heaviness
6B,and their endless number?
6B,"Does it bother you, that mercy is so difficult to"
6B,understand?
6B,For some souls it’s easy; they lie down on the sand
6B,and are soon asleep.
6B,"For others, the mind shivers in its glacial palace,"
6B,and won’t come.
6B,"Yes, the mind takes a long time, is otherwise occupied"
6B,"than by happiness, and deep breathing."
6B,"Now, in the distance, some bird is singing."
6B,"And now I have gathered six or seven deep red,"
6B,"half-opened cups of petals between my hands,"
6B,and now I have put my face against them
6B,"and now I am moving my face back and forth, slowly,"
6B,against them.
6B,The body is not much more than two feet and a tongue.
6B,"Come to me, says the blue sky, and say the word."
6B,"And finally even the mind comes running, like a wild thing,"
6B,and lies down in the sand.
6B,"Eternity is not later, or in any unfindable place."
6B,"Roses, roses, roses, roses."
A MEETING,She steps into the dark swamp
A MEETING,where the long wait ends.
A MEETING,The secret slippery package
A MEETING,drops to the weeds.
A MEETING,She leans her long neck and tongues it
A MEETING,between breaths slack with exhaustion
A MEETING,and after a while it rises and becomes a creature
A MEETING,"like her, but much smaller."
A MEETING,So now there are two. And they walk together
A MEETING,like a dream under the trees.
A MEETING,"In early June, at the edge of a field"
A MEETING,thick with pink and yellow flowers
A MEETING,I meet them.
A MEETING,I can only stare.
A MEETING,She is the most beautiful woman
A MEETING,I have ever seen.
A MEETING,"Her child leaps among the flowers,"
A MEETING,the blue of the sky falls over me
A MEETING,"like silk, the flowers burn, and I want"
A MEETING,"to live my life all over again, to begin again,"
A MEETING,to be utterly
A MEETING,wild.

AN OLD STORY,Sleep comes its little while. Then I wake
AN OLD STORY,in the valley of midnight or three a.m.
AN OLD STORY,to the first fragrances of spring
AN OLD STORY,"which is coming, all by itself, no matter what."
AN OLD STORY,"My heart says, what you thought you have you do not have."
AN OLD STORY,"My body says, will this pounding ever stop?"
AN OLD STORY,"My heart says: there, there, be a good student."
AN OLD STORY,"My body says: let me up and out, I want to fondle"
AN OLD STORY,"those soft white flowers, open in the night."
AT BLACKWATER POND,At Blackwater Pond the tossed waters have settled
AT BLACKWATER POND,after a night of rain.
AT BLACKWATER POND,I dip my cupped hands. I drink
AT BLACKWATER POND,a long time. It tastes
AT BLACKWATER POND,"like stone, leaves, fire. It falls cold"
AT BLACKWATER POND,"into my body, waking the bones. I hear them"
AT BLACKWATER POND,"deep inside me, whispering"
AT BLACKWATER POND,oh what is that beautiful thing
AT BLACKWATER POND,that just happened?
AUGUST,When the blackberries hang
AUGUST,"swollen in the woods, in the brambles"
AUGUST,"nobody owns, I spend"
AUGUST,all day among the high
AUGUST,"branches, reaching"
AUGUST,"my ripped arms, thinking"
AUGUST,"of nothing, cramming"
AUGUST,the black honey of summer
AUGUST,into my mouth; all day my body
AUGUST,accepts what it is. In the dark
AUGUST,creeks that run by there is
AUGUST,this thick paw of my life darting among
AUGUST,"the black bells, the leaves; there is"
AUGUST,this happy tongue
AUNT LEAF,"Needing one, I invented her—"
AUNT LEAF,the great-great-aunt dark as hickory
AUNT LEAF,"called Shining-Leaf, or Drifting-Cloud"
AUNT LEAF,or The-Beauty-of-the-Night.
AUNT LEAF,"Dear aunt, I’d call into the leaves,"
AUNT LEAF,"and she’d rise up, like an old log in a pool,"
AUNT LEAF,and whisper in a language only the two of us knew
AUNT LEAF,"the word that meant follow,"
AUNT LEAF,and we’d travel
AUNT LEAF,cheerful as birds
AUNT LEAF,out of the dusty town and into the trees
AUNT LEAF,where she would change us both into something quicker—
AUNT LEAF,"two foxes with black feet,"
AUNT LEAF,"two snakes green as ribbons,"
AUNT LEAF,two shimmering fish—
AUNT LEAF,and all day we’d travel.
AUNT LEAF,At day’s end she’d leave me back at my own door
AUNT LEAF,"with the rest of my family,"
AUNT LEAF,"who were kind, but solid as wood"
AUNT LEAF,"and rarely wandered. While she,"
AUNT LEAF,"old twist of feathers and birch bark,"
AUNT LEAF,would walk in circles wide as rain and then
AUNT LEAF,float back
AUNT LEAF,scattering the rags of twilight
AUNT LEAF,on fluttering moth wings;
AUNT LEAF,or she’d slouch from the barn like a gray opossum;
AUNT LEAF,or she’d hang in the milky moonlight
AUNT LEAF,"burning like a medallion,"
AUNT LEAF,"this bone dream,"
AUNT LEAF,"this friend I had to have,"
AUNT LEAF,this old woman made out of leaves.
BEAVER MOON,When somewhere life
BEAVER MOON,"breaks like a pane of glass,"
BEAVER MOON,and from every direction casual
BEAVER MOON,"voices are bringing you the news,"
BEAVER MOON,you say: I should have known.
BEAVER MOON,You say: I should have been aware.
BEAVER MOON,That last Friday he looked
BEAVER MOON,"so ill, like an old mountain-climber"
BEAVER MOON,"lost on the white trails, listening"
BEAVER MOON,"to the ice breaking upward, under"
BEAVER MOON,his worn-out shoes. You say:
BEAVER MOON,"I heard rumors of trouble, but after all"
BEAVER MOON,we all have that. You say:
BEAVER MOON,what could I have done? and you go
BEAVER MOON,"with the rest, to bury him."
BEAVER MOON,"That night, you turn in your bed"
BEAVER MOON,"to watch the moon rise, and once more"
BEAVER MOON,see what a small coin it is
BEAVER MOON,"against the darkness, and how everything else"
BEAVER MOON,"is a mystery, and you know"
BEAVER MOON,nothing at all except
BEAVER MOON,the moonlight is beautiful—
BEAVER MOON,white rivers running together
BEAVER MOON,along the bare boughs of the trees—
BEAVER MOON,"and somewhere, for someone, life"
BEAVER MOON,is becoming moment by moment
BEAVER MOON,unbearable.
BENJAMIN,What shall I do?
BENJAMIN,When I pick up the broom
BENJAMIN,he leaves the room.
BENJAMIN,When I fuss with kindling he
BENJAMIN,runs for the yard.
BENJAMIN,"Then he’s back, and we"
BENJAMIN,hug for a long time.
BENJAMIN,In his low-to-the-ground chest
BENJAMIN,I can hear his heart slowing down.
BENJAMIN,Then I rub his shoulders and
BENJAMIN,kiss his feet
BENJAMIN,and fondle his long hound ears.
BENJAMIN,"Benny, I say,"
BENJAMIN,don’t worry. I also know the way
BENJAMIN,the old life haunts the new.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"Over the local stations, one by one,"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,Announcers list disasters like dark poems
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,That always happen in the skull of winter.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,But once again the storm has passed us by:
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"Lovely and moderate, the snow lies down"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"While shouting children hurry back to play,"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,And scarved and smiling citizens once more
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,Sweep down their easy paths of pride and welcome.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,And what else might we do? Let us be truthful.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,Two counties north the storm has taken lives.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"Two counties north, to us, is far away,—"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"A land of trees, a wing upon a map,"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"A wild place never visited,—so we"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,Forget with ease each far mortality.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,Peacefully from our frozen yards we watch
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,Our children running on the mild white hills.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"This is the landscape that we understand,—"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"And till the principle of things takes root,"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,How shall examples move us from our calm?
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,I do not say that it is not a fault.
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,"I only say, except as we have loved,"
BEYOND THE SNOW BELT,All news arrives as from a distant land.
BLACK OAKS,"Okay, not one can write a symphony, or a dictionary,"
BLACK OAKS,"or even a letter to an old friend, full of remembrance"
BLACK OAKS,and comfort.
BLACK OAKS,"Not one can manage a single sound, though the blue jays"
BLACK OAKS,"carp and whistle all day in the branches, without"
BLACK OAKS,the push of the wind.
BLACK OAKS,But to tell the truth after a while I’m pale with longing
BLACK OAKS,for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen
BLACK OAKS,"and you can’t keep me from the woods, from the tonnage"
BLACK OAKS,"of their shoulders, and their shining green hair."
BLACK OAKS,"Today is a day like any other: twenty-four hours, a"
BLACK OAKS,"little sunshine, a little rain."
BLACK OAKS,"Listen, says ambition, nervously shifting her weight from"
BLACK OAKS,one boot to another—why don’t you get going?
BLACK OAKS,"For there I am, in the mossy shadows, under the trees."
BLACK OAKS,And to tell the truth I don’t want to let go of the wrists
BLACK OAKS,"of idleness, I don’t want to sell my life for money,"
BLACK OAKS,I don’t even want to come in out of the rain.
BLACKBERRIES,I come down.
BLACKBERRIES,Come down the blacktop road from Red Rock.
BLACKBERRIES,A hot day.
BLACKBERRIES,Off the road in the hacked tangles
BLACKBERRIES,blackberries big as thumbs hang shining
BLACKBERRIES,in the shade. And a creek nearby: a dark
BLACKBERRIES,spit through wet stones. And a pool
BLACKBERRIES,like a stonesink if you know
BLACKBERRIES,where to climb for it among
BLACKBERRIES,"the hillside ferns, where the thrush"
BLACKBERRIES,naps in her nest of sticks and loam. I
BLACKBERRIES,"come down from Red Rock, lips streaked"
BLACKBERRIES,"black, fingers purple, throat cool, shirt"
BLACKBERRIES,"full of fernfingers, head full of windy"
BLACKBERRIES,whistling. It
BLACKBERRIES,takes all day.
BLUE IRIS,"Now that I’m free to be myself, who am I?"
BLUE IRIS,"Can’t fly, can’t run, and see how slowly I walk."
BLUE IRIS,"Well, I think, I can read books."
BLUE IRIS,What’s that you’re doing?
BLUE IRIS,the green-headed fly shouts as it buzzes past.
BLUE IRIS,I close the book.
BLUE IRIS,"Well, I can write down words, like these, softly."
BLUE IRIS,"What’s that you’re doing? whispers the wind, pausing"
BLUE IRIS,in a heap just outside the window.
BLUE IRIS,"Give me a little time, I say back to its staring, silver face."
BLUE IRIS,"It doesn’t happen all of a sudden, you know."
BLUE IRIS,"Doesn’t it? says the wind, and breaks open, releasing"
BLUE IRIS,distillation of blue iris.
BLUE IRIS,"And my heart panics not to be, as I long to be,"
BLUE IRIS,"the empty, waiting, pure, speechless receptacle."
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"Make of yourself a light,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"said the Buddha,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,before he died.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,I think of this every morning
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,as the east begins
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,to tear off its many clouds
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"of darkness, to send up the first"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,signal—a white fan
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"streaked with pink and violet,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,even green.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"An old man, he lay down"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"between two sala trees,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"and he might have said anything,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,knowing it was his final hour.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"The light burns upward,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,it thickens and settles over the fields.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"Around him, the villagers gathered"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,and stretched forward to listen.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,Even before the sun itself
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"hangs, disattached, in the blue air,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,I am touched everywhere
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,by its ocean of yellow waves.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,No doubt he thought of everything
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,that had happened in his difficult life.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,And then I feel the sun itself
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"as it blazes over the hills,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,like a million flowers on fire—
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"clearly I’m not needed,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,yet I feel myself turning
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,into something of inexplicable value.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,"Slowly, beneath the branches,"
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,he raised his head.
BUDDHA’S LAST INSTRUCTION,He looked into the faces of that frightened crowd.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"For example, what the trees do"
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,not only in lightning storms
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,or the watery dark of a summer night
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,or under the white nets of winter
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"but now, and now, and now—whenever"
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,we’re not looking. Surely you can’t imagine
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,they just stand there looking the way they look
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,when we’re looking; surely you can’t imagine
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"they don’t dance, from the root up, wishing"
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"to travel a little, not cramped so much as wanting"
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"a better view, or more sun, or just as avidly"
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,more shade—surely you can’t imagine they just
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,stand there loving every
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"minute of it; the birds or the emptiness, the dark rings"
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,of the years slowly and without a sound
CAN YOU IMAGINE?,"thickening, and nothing different unless the wind,"

CATBIRD,"He picks his pond, and the soft thicket of his world."
CATBIRD,"He bids his lady come, and she does,"
CATBIRD,flirting with her tail.
CATBIRD,"He begins early, and makes up his song as he goes."
CATBIRD,"He does not enter a house at night, or when it rains."
CATBIRD,"He is not afraid of the wind, though he is cautious."
CATBIRD,"He watches the snake, that stripe of black fire,"
CATBIRD,until it flows away.
CATBIRD,"He watches the hawk with her sharpest shins, aloft"
CATBIRD,in the high tree.
CATBIRD,He keeps his prayer under his tongue.
CATBIRD,In his whole life he has never missed the rising of the sun.
CATBIRD,He dislikes snow.
CATBIRD,But a few raisins give him the greatest delight.
CATBIRD,"He sits in the forelock of the lilac, or he struts"
CATBIRD,in its shadow.
CATBIRD,"He is neither the rare plover or the brilliant bunting,"
CATBIRD,but as common as grass.
CATBIRD,"His black cap gives him a jaunty look, for which"
CATBIRD,"we humans have learned to tilt our caps, in envy."
CATBIRD,"When he is not singing, he is listening."
CATBIRD,Neither have I ever seen him with his eyes closed.
CATBIRD,Though he may be looking at nothing more than a cloud
CATBIRD,it brings to his mind a several dozen new remarks.
CATBIRD,"From one branch to another, or across the path,"
CATBIRD,he dazzles with flight.
CATBIRD,"Since I see him every morning, I have rewarded myself"
CATBIRD,the pleasure of thinking that he knows me.
CATBIRD,"Yet never, once has he answered my nod."
CATBIRD,"He seems, in fact, to find in me a kind of humor,"
CATBIRD,"I am so vast, uncertain and strange."
CATBIRD,"I am the one who comes and goes,"
CATBIRD,and who knows why.
CATBIRD,Will I ever understand him?
CATBIRD,"Certainly he will never understand me, or the world"
CATBIRD,I come from.
CATBIRD,For he will never sing for the kingdom of dollars.
CATBIRD,For he will never grow pockets in his gray wings.
CLAPP’S POND,Three miles through the woods
CLAPP’S POND,Clapp’s Pond sprawls stone gray
CLAPP’S POND,"among oaks and pines,"
CLAPP’S POND,the late winter fields
CLAPP’S POND,where a pheasant blazes up
CLAPP’S POND,lifting his yellow legs
CLAPP’S POND,"under bronze feathers, opening"
CLAPP’S POND,bronze wings;
CLAPP’S POND,"and one doe, dimpling the ground as she touches"
CLAPP’S POND,"its dampness sharply, flares"
CLAPP’S POND,out of the brush and gallops away.
CLAPP’S POND,By evening: rain.
CLAPP’S POND,"It pours down from the black clouds,"
CLAPP’S POND,lashes over the roof. The last
CLAPP’S POND,acorns spray over the porch; I toss
CLAPP’S POND,"one, then two more"
CLAPP’S POND,logs on the fire.
CLAPP’S POND,How sometimes everything
CLAPP’S POND,"closes up, a painted fan, landscapes and moments"
CLAPP’S POND,flowing together until the sense of distance—
CLAPP’S POND,"say, between Clapp’s Pond and me—"
CLAPP’S POND,"vanishes, edges slide together"
CLAPP’S POND,"like the feathers of a wing, everything"
CLAPP’S POND,touches everything.
DAISIES,"It is possible, I suppose, that sometime"
DAISIES,we will learn everything
DAISIES,"there is to learn: what the world is, for example,"
DAISIES,and what it means. I think this as I am crossing
DAISIES,"from one field to another, in summer, and the"
DAISIES,"mockingbird is mocking me, as one who either"
DAISIES,knows enough already or knows enough to be
DAISIES,perfectly content not knowing. Song being born
DAISIES,of quest he knows this: he must turn silent
DAISIES,were he suddenly assaulted with answers. Instead
DAISIES,"oh hear his wild, caustic, tender warbling ceaselessly"
DAISIES,unanswered. At my feet the white-petaled daisies display
DAISIES,"the small suns of their center-piece—their, if you don’t"
DAISIES,mind my saying so—their hearts. Of course
DAISIES,"I could be wrong, perhaps their hearts are pale and"
DAISIES,narrow and hidden in the roots. What do I know.
DAISIES,"But this: it is heaven itself to take what is given,"
DAISIES,to see what is plain; what the sun
DAISIES,lights up willingly; for example—I think this
DAISIES,"as I reach down, not to pick but merely to touch"
DAISIES,"the suitability of the field for the daisies, and the"
DAISIES,daisies for the field.
DO STONES FEEL?,Do stones feel?
DO STONES FEEL?,Do they love their life?
DO STONES FEEL?,Or does their patience drown out everything else?
DO STONES FEEL?,When I walk on the beach I gather a few
DO STONES FEEL?,"white ones, dark ones, the multiple colors."
DO STONES FEEL?,"Don’t worry, I say, I’ll bring you back, and I do."
DO STONES FEEL?,Is the tree as it rises delighted with its many
DO STONES FEEL?,"branches,"
DO STONES FEEL?,each one like a poem?
DO STONES FEEL?,Are the clouds glad to unburden their bundles of rain?
DO STONES FEEL?,"Most of the world says no, no, it’s not possible."
DO STONES FEEL?,I refuse to think to such a conclusion.
DO STONES FEEL?,"Too terrible it would be, to be wrong."

FIREFLIES,At Blackwater
FIREFLIES,fireflies
FIREFLIES,are not even a dime a dozen—
FIREFLIES,"they are free,"
FIREFLIES,and each floats and turns
FIREFLIES,among the branches of the oaks
FIREFLIES,and the swamp azaleas
FIREFLIES,looking for another
FIREFLIES,"as, who doesn’t?"
FIREFLIES,"Oh, blessings"
FIREFLIES,on the intimacy
FIREFLIES,"inside fruition,"
FIREFLIES,be it foxes
FIREFLIES,or the fireflies
FIREFLIES,or the dampness inside the petals
FIREFLIES,of a thousand flowers.
FIREFLIES,Though Eden is lost
FIREFLIES,its loveliness
FIREFLIES,remains in the heart
FIREFLIES,and the imagination;
FIREFLIES,he would take her
FIREFLIES,in a boat
FIREFLIES,over the dark water;
FIREFLIES,she would take him
FIREFLIES,to an island she knows
FIREFLIES,where the blue flag grows wild
FIREFLIES,"and the grass is deep,"
FIREFLIES,where the birds
FIREFLIES,"perch together,"
FIREFLIES,"feather to feather,"
FIREFLIES,on the bough.
FIREFLIES,"And the fireflies,"
FIREFLIES,"blinking their little lights,"
FIREFLIES,hurry toward one another.
FIREFLIES,"And the world continues,"
FIREFLIES,God willing.
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,I’d seen
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,their hoofprints in the deep
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,needles and knew
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,they ended the long night
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"under the pines, walking"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,like two mute
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,and beautiful women toward
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"the deeper woods, so I"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,got up in the dark and
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,went there. They came
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,slowly down the hill
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,and looked at me sitting under
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"the blue trees, shyly"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,they stepped
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,closer and stared
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,from under their thick lashes and even
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,nibbled some damp
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,tassels of weeds. This
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"is not a poem about a dream,"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,though it could be.
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,This is a poem about the world
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"that is ours, or could be."
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,Finally
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,one of them—I swear it!—
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,would have come to my arms.
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,But the other
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,stamped sharp hoof in the
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,pine needles like
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"the tap of sanity,"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,and they went off together through
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,the trees. When I woke
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"I was alone,"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,I was thinking:
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"so this is how you swim inward,"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,"so this is how you flow outward,"
FIVE A.M. IN THE PINEWOODS,so this is how you pray.
FLARE,"Welcome to the silly, comforting poem."
FLARE,"It is not the sunrise,"
FLARE,"which is a red rinse,"
FLARE,which is flaring all over the eastern sky;
FLARE,it is not the rain falling out of the purse of God;
FLARE,"it is not the blue helmet of the sky afterward,"
FLARE,"or the trees, or the beetle burrowing into the earth;"
FLARE,"it is not the mockingbird who, in his own cadence,"
FLARE,will go on sizzling and clapping
FLARE,"from the branches of the catalpa that are thick with blossoms,"
FLARE,"that are billowing and shining,"
FLARE,that are shaking in the wind.
FOX,You don’t ever know where
FOX,"a sentence will take you, depending"
FOX,on its roll and fold. I was walking
FOX,over the dunes when I saw
FOX,the red fox asleep under the green
FOX,branches of the pine. It flared up
FOX,"in the sweet order of its being,"
FOX,the tail that was over the muzzle
FOX,lifting in airy amazement
FOX,and the fire of the eyes followed
FOX,and the pricked ears and the thin
FOX,barrel body and the four
FOX,athletic legs in their black stockings and it
FOX,came to me how the polish of the world changes
FOX,"everything, I was hot I was cold I was almost"
FOX,dead of delight. Of course the mind keeps
FOX,"cool in its hidden palace—yes, the mind takes"
FOX,"a long time, is otherwise occupied than by"
FOX,"happiness, and deep breathing. Still,"
FOX,"at last, it comes too, running"
FOX,"like a wild thing, to be taken"
FOX,"with its twin sister, breath. So I stood"
FOX,"on the pale, peach-colored sand, watching the fox"
FOX,"as it opened like a flower, and I began"
FOX,"softly, to pick among the vast assortment of words"
FOX,that it should run again and again across the page
FOX,that you again and again should shiver with praise.
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",But when I came back I found
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",that the body of the river was dying.
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",Did it speak?
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK","Yes, it sang out the old songs, but faintly."
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",What will you do?
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK","I will grieve of course, but that’s nothing."
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK","What, precisely, will you grieve for?"
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK","For the river. For myself, my lost"
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",joyfulness. For the children who will not
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK","know what a river can be—a friend, a"
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK","companion, a hint of heaven."
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",Isn’t this somewhat overplayed?
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",I said: it can be a friend. A companion. A
"FROM THIS RIVER, WHEN I WAS A CHILD, I USED TO DRINK",hint of heaven.
GETHSEMANE,The grass never sleeps.
GETHSEMANE,Or the roses.
GETHSEMANE,Nor does the lily have a secret eye that shuts until morning.
GETHSEMANE,"Jesus said, wait with me. But the disciples slept."
GETHSEMANE,"The cricket has such splendid fringe on its feet,"
GETHSEMANE,"and it sings, have you noticed, with its whole body,"
GETHSEMANE,and heaven knows if it ever sleeps.
GETHSEMANE,"Jesus said, wait with me. And maybe the stars did, maybe"
GETHSEMANE,"the wind wound itself into a silver tree, and didn’t move,"
GETHSEMANE,maybe
GETHSEMANE,"the lake far away, where once he walked as on a"
GETHSEMANE,"blue pavement,"
GETHSEMANE,"lay still and waited, wild awake."
GETHSEMANE,"Oh the dear bodies, slumped and eye-shut, that could not"
GETHSEMANE,"keep that vigil, how they must have wept,"
GETHSEMANE,"so utterly human, knowing this too"
GETHSEMANE,must be a part of the story
GHOSTS,Where so many millions of powerful bawling beasts
GHOSTS,lay down on the earth and died
GHOSTS,it’s hard to tell now
GHOSTS,"what’s bone, and what merely"
GHOSTS,was once.
GHOSTS,"The golden eagle, for instance,"
GHOSTS,has a bit of heaviness in him;
GHOSTS,moreover the huge barns
GHOSTS,"seem ready, sometimes, to ramble off"
GHOSTS,toward deeper grass.
GOING TO WALDEN,It isn’t very far as highways lie.
GOING TO WALDEN,"I might be back by nightfall, having seen"
GOING TO WALDEN,"The rough pines, and the stones, and the clear water."
GOING TO WALDEN,Friends argue that I might be wiser for it.
GOING TO WALDEN,They do not hear that far-off Yankee whisper:
GOING TO WALDEN,How dull we grow from hurrying here and there!
GOING TO WALDEN,"Many have gone, and think me half a fool"
GOING TO WALDEN,To miss a day away in the cool country.
GOING TO WALDEN,"Maybe. But in a book I read and cherish,"
GOING TO WALDEN,Going to Walden is not so easy a thing
GOING TO WALDEN,As a green visit. It is the slow and difficult
GOING TO WALDEN,"Trick of living, and finding it where you are."
GOLDENROD,"On roadsides,"
GOLDENROD,"in fall fields,"
GOLDENROD,"in rumpy bunches,"
GOLDENROD,"saffron and orange and pale gold,"
GOLDENROD,"in little towers,"
GOLDENROD,"soft as mash,"
GOLDENROD,"sneeze-bringers and seed-bearers,"
GOLDENROD,full of bees and yellow beads and perfect flowerlets
GOLDENROD,and orange butterflies.
GOLDENROD,I don’t suppose
GOLDENROD,"much notice comes of it, except for honey,"
GOLDENROD,and how it heartens the heart with its
GOLDENROD,blank blaze.
GOLDENROD,"I don’t suppose anything loves it except, perhaps,"
GOLDENROD,the rocky voids
GOLDENROD,filled by its dumb dazzle.
GOLDENROD,"For myself,"
GOLDENROD,"I was just passing by, when the wind flared"
GOLDENROD,"and the blossoms rustled,"
GOLDENROD,and the glittering pandemonium
GOLDENROD,leaned on me.
GOLDENROD,I was just minding my own business
GOLDENROD,"when I found myself on their straw hillsides,"
GOLDENROD,"citron and butter-colored,"
GOLDENROD,"and was happy, and why not?"
GOLDENROD,Are not the difficult labors of our lives
GOLDENROD,full of dark hours?
GOLDENROD,"And what has consciousness come to anyway, so far,"
GOLDENROD,that is better than these light-filled bodies?
GOLDENROD,All day
GOLDENROD,on their airy backbones
GOLDENROD,"they toss in the wind,"
GOLDENROD,"they bend as though it was natural and godly to bend,"
GOLDENROD,"they rise in a stiff sweetness,"
GOLDENROD,in the pure peace of giving
GOLDENROD,one’s gold away.
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",This morning the goldenrod are all wearing
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",their golden shirts
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",fresh from heaven’s soft wash in the chill night.
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",So it must be a celebration.
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","And here comes the wind, so many swinging wings!"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","Has he been invited, or is he the intruder?"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","Invited, whisper the golden pebbles of the weeds,"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",as they begin to fall
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","over the ground. Well, you would think the little murmurs"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",of the broken blossoms would have said
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","otherwise, but no. So I sit down among them to"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",think about it while all around me the crumbling
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",goes on. The weeds let down their seedy faces
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","cheerfully, which is the part I like best, and certainly"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",it is as good as a book for learning from. You would think
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",they were just going for a small sleep. You would think
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","they couldn’t wait, it was going to be"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","that snug and even, as all their lives were, full of"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",excitation. You would think
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","it was a voyage just beginning, and no darkness anywhere,"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","but tinged with all necessary instruction, and light,"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","and all were shriven, as all the round world is,"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL","and so it wasn’t anything but easy to fall, to whisper"
"GOLDENROD, LATE FALL",Good Night.
HONEY LOCUST,Who can tell how lovely in June is the
HONEY LOCUST,"honey locust tree, or why"
HONEY LOCUST,a tree should be so sweet and live
HONEY LOCUST,in this world? Each white blossom
HONEY LOCUST,on a dangle of white flowers holds one green seed—
HONEY LOCUST,a new life. Also each blossom on a dangle of flowers
HONEY LOCUST,holds a flask
HONEY LOCUST,"of fragrance called Heaven, which is never sealed."
HONEY LOCUST,The bees circle the tree and dive into it. They are crazy
HONEY LOCUST,with gratitude. They are working like farmers. They are as
HONEY LOCUST,happy as saints. After a while the flowers begin to
HONEY LOCUST,wilt and drop down into the grass. Welcome
HONEY LOCUST,shines in the grass.
HONEY LOCUST,Every year I gather
HONEY LOCUST,handfuls of blossoms and eat of their mealiness; the honey
HONEY LOCUST,"melts in my mouth, the seeds make me strong,"
HONEY LOCUST,"both when they are crisp and ripe, and even at the end"
HONEY LOCUST,when their petals have turned dull yellow.
HONEY LOCUST,So it is
HONEY LOCUST,"if the heart has devoted itself to love, there is"
HONEY LOCUST,not a single inch of emptiness. Gladness gleams
HONEY LOCUST,all the way to the grave.
HOW WOULD YOU LIVE THEN?,What if a hundred rose-breasted grosbeaks
HOW WOULD YOU LIVE THEN?,flew in circles around your head? What if

HOW WOULD YOU LIVE THEN?,this way and that way above the clouds? What if
HOW WOULD YOU LIVE THEN?,"you painted a picture of a tree, and the leaves"

HUM,What is this dark hum among the roses?
HUM,"The bees have gone simple, sipping,"
HUM,that’s all. What did you expect? Sophistication?
HUM,They’re small creatures and they are
HUM,"filling their bodies with sweetness, how could they not"
HUM,moan in happiness? The little
HUM,"worker bee lives, I have read, about three weeks."
HUM,"Is that long? Long enough, I suppose, to understand"

HUM,"stopped in the very cups of the flowers, their wings"
HUM,"a little tattered—so much flying about, to the hive,"
HUM,"then out into the world, then back, and perhaps dancing,"
HUM,"should the task be to be a scout—sweet, dancing bee."
HUM,I think there isn’t anything in this world I don’t
HUM,"admire. If there is, I don’t know what it is. I"
HUM,"haven’t met it yet. Nor expect to. The bee is small,"
HUM,"and since I wear glasses, so I can see the traffic and"
HUM,"read books, I have to"
HUM,take them off and bend close to study and
HUM,"understand what is happening. It’s not hard, it’s in fact"
HUM,"as instructive as anything I have ever studied. Plus, too,"
HUM,"it’s love almost too fierce to endure, the bee"
HUM,nuzzling like that into the blouse
HUM,"of the rose. And the fragrance, and the honey, and of course"
HUM,"the sun, the purely pure sun, shining, all the while, over"
HUM,all of us.
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,I go down to the shore in the morning
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,and depending on the hour the waves
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,"are rolling in or moving out,"
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,"and I say, oh, I am miserable,"
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,what shall—
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,what should I do? And the sea says
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,in its lovely voice:
I GO DOWN TO THE SHORE,"Excuse me, I have work to do."
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,Why do people keep asking to see
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,God’s identity papers
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,when the darkness opening into morning
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,is more than enough?
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,Certainly any god might turn away in disgust.
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,Think of Sheba approaching
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,the kingdom of Solomon.
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,"Do you think she had to ask,"
I WAKE CLOSE TO MORNING,Is this the place?
JACK,The wagons stand
JACK,"And rust, and glitter sometimes in the moon,"
JACK,Since we have lost dominion of the fields.
JACK,"No more great clattering Jack,"
JACK,"His thick mane filled with chaff and wind,"
JACK,Will let us lead him from the easy barns;
JACK,No more sweet gentle Jack
JACK,Will let us strap him to his leather bondage
JACK,And help us tow the weight of summer home.
JACK,The days
JACK,"Are easier now, and we have time for thought,"
JACK,Idling in corners of our weedy land.
JACK,"But now we learn, as season follows season"
JACK,"And no one plants upon these hills,"
JACK,How poor a gift is freedom to the spirit
JACK,"That loved the labor. Now, like Jack,"
JACK,"We stand turned out into eternal Sunday,"
JACK,And look through moonlight at the silenced wagons.
JACK,"Yet we have lives to balance our regret,"
JACK,Can turn to other things.
JACK,"Now in the moonlight we can move away,"
JACK,While he is left staring upon the stark
JACK,Arrangement of the wagons leaning earthward:
JACK,"The simple blood that cannot name its lack,"
JACK,"But knows the world has fallen out of reason,"
JACK,"That it is autumn, and no laborer comes."
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,I think sometimes of the possible glamour of death—
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,that it might be wonderful to be
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,lost and happy inside the green grass—
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,or to be the green grass!—
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"or, maybe the pink rose, or the blue iris,"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"or the affable daisy, or the twirled vine"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,looping its way skyward—that it might be perfectly peaceful
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"to be the shining lake, or the hurrying, athletic river,"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,or the dark shoulders of the trees
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,where the thrush each evening weeps himself into an ecstasy.
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"I lie down in the fields of goldenrod, and everlasting."
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,Who could find me?
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,My thoughts simplify. I have not done a thousand things
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"or a hundred things but, perhaps, a few."
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,As for wondering about answers that are not available except
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"in books, though all my childhood I was sent there"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"to find them, I have learned"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,to leave all that behind
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"as in summer I take off my shoes and my socks,"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"my jacket, my hat, and go on"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"happier, through the fields. The little sparrow"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,with the pink beak

JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,but to the whole world. All afternoon
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"I grow wiser, listening to him,"
JUST LYING ON THE GRASS AT BLACKWATER,"soft, small, nameless fellow at the top of some weed,"

LEARNING ABOUT THE INDIANS,"He danced in feathers, with paint across his nose."
LEARNING ABOUT THE INDIANS,"Thump, thump went the drum, and bumped our blood,"

LINGERING IN HAPPINESS,"After rain after many days without rain,"
LINGERING IN HAPPINESS,"it stays cool, private and cleansed, under the trees,"

LONELINESS,I too have known loneliness.
LONELINESS,I too have known what it is to feel
LONELINESS,"misunderstood,"

MINK,"A mink,"
MINK,"jointless as heat, was"
MINK,tip-toeing along
MINK,"the edge of the creek,"
MINK,"which was still in its coat of snow,"
MINK,yet singing—I could hear it!—
MINK,the old song
MINK,of brightness.
MINK,"It was one of those places,"
MINK,"turning and twisty,"
MINK,"that Ruskin might have painted, though"
MINK,he didn’t. And there were trees
MINK,"leaning this way and that,"
MINK,seed-beaded
MINK,"buckthorn mostly, but at the moment"
MINK,"no bird, the only voice"
MINK,"that of the covered water—like a long,"
MINK,"unknotted thread, it kept"
MINK,slipping through. The mink
MINK,had a hunger in him
MINK,"bigger than his shadow, which was gathered"
MINK,like a sheet of darkness under his
MINK,neat feet which were busy
MINK,making dents in the snow. He sniffed
MINK,slowly and thoroughly in all
MINK,"four directions, as though"
MINK,"it was a prayer to the whole world, as far"
MINK,as he could capture its beautiful
MINK,"smells—the iron of the air, the blood"
MINK,"of necessity. Maybe, for him, even"
MINK,the pink sun fading away to the edge
MINK,"of the world had a smell,"
MINK,"of roses, or of terror, who knows"
MINK,what his keen nose was
MINK,"finding out. For me, it was the gift of the winter"
MINK,"to see him. Once, like a hot, dark-brown pillar,"
MINK,"he stood up—and then he ran forward, and was gone."
MINK,I stood awhile and then walked on
MINK,"over the white snow: the terrible, gleaming"
MINK,"loneliness. It took me, I suppose,"
MINK,something like six more weeks to reach
MINK,"finally a patch of green, I paused so often"
MINK,"to be glad, and grateful, and even then carefully across"
MINK,"the vast, deep woods I kept looking back."
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,It’s almost dawn
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,and the usual half-miracles begin
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,within my own personal body as the light
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,enters the gates of the east and climbs
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"into the fields of the sky, and the birds lift"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,their very unimportant heads from the branches
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"and begin to sing; and the insects too,"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"and the rustling leaves, and even"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"that most common of earthly things, the grass,"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,can’t let it begin—another morning—without
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"making some comment of gladness, respiring softly"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,with the honey of their green bodies; and the white
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"blossoms of the swamp honeysuckle, hovering just where"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"the path and the pond almost meet,"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,shake from the folds of their bodies
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"such happiness it enters the air as fragrance,"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,the day’s first pale and elegant affirmation.
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,"And the old gods liked so well, they say,"
MORNING AT BLACKWATER,the sweet odor of prayer.

MORNING IN A NEW LAND,In trees still dripping night some nameless birds
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Woke, shook out their arrowy wings, and sang,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Slowly, like finches sifting through a dream."
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"The pink sun fell, like glass, into the fields."
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Two chestnuts, and a dapple gray,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Their shoulders wet with light, their dark hair streaming,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Climbed the hill. The last mist fell away,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"And under the trees, beyond time’s brittle drift,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,I stood like Adam in his lonely garden
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"On that first morning, shaken out of sleep,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Rubbing his eyes, listening, parting the leaves,"
MORNING IN A NEW LAND,"Like tissue on some vast, incredible gift."
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"For years, every morning, I drank"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,from Blackwater Pond.
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"It was flavored with oak leaves and also, no doubt,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,the feet of ducks.
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,And always it assuaged me
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,from the dry bowl of the very far past.
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,What I want to say is
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"that the past is the past,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"and the present is what your life is,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,and you are capable
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"of choosing what that will be,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,darling citizen.
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"So come to the pond,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"or the river of your imagination,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,"or the harbor of your longing,"
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,and put your lips to the world.
MORNINGS AT BLACKWATER,And live

NIGHT FLIGHT,"Traveling at thirty thousand feet, we see"
NIGHT FLIGHT,"How much of earth still lies in wilderness,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,Till terminals occur like miracles
NIGHT FLIGHT,To civilize the paralyzing dark.
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Buckled for landing to a tilting chair,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,I think: if miracle or accident
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Should send us on across the upper air,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,"How many miles, or nights, or years to go"
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Before the mind, with its huge ego paling,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Before the heart, all expectation spent,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,Should read the meaning of the scene below?
NIGHT FLIGHT,But now already the loved ones gather
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Under the dome of welcome, as we glide"
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Over the final jutting mountainside,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Across the suburbs tangled in their lights,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,And settled softly on the earth once more
NIGHT FLIGHT,Rise in the fierce assumption of our lives—
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Discarding smoothly, as we disembark,"
NIGHT FLIGHT,All thoughts that held us wiser for a moment
NIGHT FLIGHT,"Up there alone, in the impartial dark."
NO VOYAGE,"I wake earlier, now that the birds have come"
NO VOYAGE,And sing in the unfailing trees.
NO VOYAGE,On a cot by an open window
NO VOYAGE,"I lie like land used up, while spring unfolds."
NO VOYAGE,"Now of all voyagers I remember, who among them"
NO VOYAGE,Did not board ship with grief among their maps?—
NO VOYAGE,"Till it seemed men never go somewhere, they only leave"
NO VOYAGE,"Wherever they are, when the dying begins."
NO VOYAGE,"For myself, I find my wanting life"
NO VOYAGE,Implores no novelty and no disguise of distance;
NO VOYAGE,"Where, in what country, might I put down these thoughts,"
NO VOYAGE,Who still am citizen of this fallen city?
NO VOYAGE,"On a cot by an open window, I lie and remember"
NO VOYAGE,While the birds in the trees sing of the circle of time.
NO VOYAGE,"Let the dying go on, and let me, if I can,"
NO VOYAGE,Inherit from disaster before I move.
NO VOYAGE,"O, I go to see the great ships ride from harbor,"
NO VOYAGE,And my wounds leap with impatience; yet I turn back
NO VOYAGE,To sort the weeping ruins of my house:
NO VOYAGE,Here or nowhere I will make peace with the fact.
NORTH COUNTRY,In the north country now it is spring and there
NORTH COUNTRY,is a certain celebration. The thrush
NORTH COUNTRY,has come home. He is shy and likes the
NORTH COUNTRY,"evening best, also the hour just before"
NORTH COUNTRY,morning; in that blue and gritty light he
NORTH COUNTRY,"climbs to his branch, or smoothly"
NORTH COUNTRY,sails there. It is okay to know only
NORTH COUNTRY,one song if it is this one. Hear it
NORTH COUNTRY,rise and fall; the very elements of your soul
NORTH COUNTRY,shiver nicely. What would spring be
NORTH COUNTRY,"without it? Mostly frogs. But don’t worry, he"
NORTH COUNTRY,"arrives, year after year, humble and obedient"
NORTH COUNTRY,and gorgeous. You listen and you know
NORTH COUNTRY,"you could live a better life than you do, be"
NORTH COUNTRY,"softer, kinder. And maybe this year you will"
NORTH COUNTRY,be able to do it. Hear how his voice
NORTH COUNTRY,rises and falls. There is no way to be
NORTH COUNTRY,sufficiently grateful for the gifts we are
NORTH COUNTRY,"given, no way to speak the Lord’s name"
NORTH COUNTRY,"often enough, though we do try, and"
NORTH COUNTRY,"especially now, as that dappled breast"
NORTH COUNTRY,breathes in the pines and heaven’s
NORTH COUNTRY,"windows in the north country, now spring has come,"
NORTH COUNTRY,are opened wide.
OCTOBER,"There’s this shape, black as the entrance to a cave."
OCTOBER,A longing wells up in its throat
OCTOBER,like a blossom
OCTOBER,as it breathes slowly.
OCTOBER,What does the world
OCTOBER,mean to you if you can’t trust it
OCTOBER,to go on shining when you’re
OCTOBER,not there? And there’s
OCTOBER,"a tree, long-fallen; once"
OCTOBER,"the bees flew to it, like a procession"
OCTOBER,"of messengers, and filled it"
OCTOBER,with honey.
OCTOBER,"Sometimes in late summer I won’t touch anything, not"
OCTOBER,"the flowers, not the blackberries"
OCTOBER,brimming in the thickets; I won’t drink
OCTOBER,from the pond; I won’t name the birds or the trees;
OCTOBER,I won’t whisper my own name.
OCTOBER,One morning
OCTOBER,"the fox came down the hill, glittering and confident,"
OCTOBER,and didn’t see me—and I thought:
OCTOBER,so this is the world.
OCTOBER,I’m not in it.
OCTOBER,It is beautiful.

ON THE BEACH,"On the beach, at dawn:"
ON THE BEACH,four small stones clearly
ON THE BEACH,hugging each other.
ON THE BEACH,How many kinds of love

ON WINTER’S MARGIN,With half-forged memories come flocking home
ON WINTER’S MARGIN,To gardens famous for their charity.
ON WINTER’S MARGIN,The green globe’s broken; vines like tangled veins

ON WINTER’S MARGIN,"With half a loaf, I am the prince of crumbs;"

ON WINTER’S MARGIN,And what I dream of are the patient deer
ON WINTER’S MARGIN,Who stand on legs like reeds and drink the wind;—
ON WINTER’S MARGIN,They are what saves the world: who choose to grow
ON WINTER’S MARGIN,Thin to a starting point beyond this squalor.

ONE OR TWO THINGS,here and there to fuzzle the damp throats
ONE OR TWO THINGS,of flowers and the black mud; up

ONE OR TWO THINGS,for long delicious moments it is perfectly
ONE OR TWO THINGS,"lazy, riding motionless in the breeze on the soft stalk"
ONE OR TWO THINGS,of some ordinary flower.
ONE OR TWO THINGS,The god of dirt
ONE OR TWO THINGS,came up to me many times and said

Oxygen,"Everything needs it: bone, muscles, and even,"
Oxygen,"while it calls the earth its home, the soul."
Oxygen,"So the merciful, noisy machine"
Oxygen,stands in our house working away in its
Oxygen,lung-like voice. I hear it as I kneel
Oxygen,"before the fire, stirring with a"
Oxygen,"stick of iron, letting the logs"
Oxygen,"lie more loosely. You, in the upstairs room,"
Oxygen,"are in your usual position, leaning on your"
Oxygen,right shoulder which aches
Oxygen,all day. You are breathing
Oxygen,patiently; it is a
Oxygen,beautiful sound. It is
Oxygen,"your life, which is so close"
Oxygen,to my own that I would not know
Oxygen,where to drop the knife of
Oxygen,separation. And what does this have to do
Oxygen,"with love, except"
Oxygen,everything? Now the fire rises
Oxygen,"and offers a dozen, singing, deep-red"
Oxygen,roses of flame. Then it settles
Oxygen,"to quietude, or maybe gratitude, as it feeds"
Oxygen,"as we all do, as we must, upon the invisible gift:"
Oxygen,"our purest, sweet necessity: the air."

PEONIES,boring their deep and mysterious holes
PEONIES,"into the curls,"
PEONIES,"craving the sweet sap,"
PEONIES,taking it away
PEONIES,"to their dark, underground cities—"
PEONIES,and all day
PEONIES,"under the shifty wind,"
PEONIES,"as in a dance to the great wedding,"
PEONIES,"the flowers bend their bright bodies,"

PEONIES,"and rise,"

SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,to the fields of mustard yellow
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,and orange and plain
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,gold all eternity
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,is in the moment this is what
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,Blake said Whitman said such
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,wisdom in the agitated
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,motions of the mind seven
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,dancers floating
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,even as worms toward
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,paradise see how they banter
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,and riot and rise
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,to the trees flutter
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,lob their white bodies into
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,the invisible wind weightless
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,lacy willing
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,to deliver themselves unto
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,the universe now each settles
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,down on a yellow thumb on a
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,brassy stem now
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,all seven are rapidly sipping
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,from the golden towers who
SEVEN WHITE BUTTERFLIES,would have thought it could be so easy?
SHADOWS,Everyone knows the great energies running amok cast
SHADOWS,"terrible shadows, that each of the so-called"
SHADOWS,senseless acts has its thread looping
SHADOWS,back through the world and into a human heart.
SHADOWS,And meanwhile
SHADOWS,the gold-trimmed thunder
SHADOWS,wanders the sky; the river
SHADOWS,may be filling the cellars of the sleeping town.
SHADOWS,"Cyclone, fire, and their merry cousins"
SHADOWS,bring us to grief—but these are the hours
SHADOWS,with the old wooden-god faces;
SHADOWS,we lift them to our shoulders like so many
SHADOWS,"black coffins, we continue walking"
SHADOWS,into the future. I don’t mean
SHADOWS,"there are no bodies in the river,"
SHADOWS,or bones broken by the wind. I mean
SHADOWS,everyone who has heard the lethal train-roar
SHADOWS,of the tornado swears there was no mention ever
SHADOWS,"of any person, or reason—I mean"
SHADOWS,the waters rise without any plot upon
SHADOWS,"history, or even geography. Whatever"
SHADOWS,"power of the earth rampages, we turn to it"
SHADOWS,dazed but anonymous eyes; whatever
SHADOWS,"the name of the catastrophe, it is never"
SHADOWS,the opposite of love.
SINGAPORE,I wouldn’t mind being a rose
SINGAPORE,in a field full of roses.
SINGAPORE,"Fear has not yet occurred to them, nor ambition."
SINGAPORE,Reason they have not yet thought of.
SINGAPORE,"Neither do they ask how long they must be roses, and then what."
SINGAPORE,Or any other foolish question.
SINGAPORE,"In Singapore, in the airport,"
SINGAPORE,a darkness was ripped from my eyes.
SINGAPORE,"In the women’s restroom, one compartment stood open."
SINGAPORE,"A woman knelt there, washing something"
SINGAPORE,in the white bowl.
SINGAPORE,Disgust argued in my stomach
SINGAPORE,"and I felt, in my pocket, for my ticket."
SINGAPORE,A poem should always have birds in it.
SINGAPORE,"Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings,"
SINGAPORE,"Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees."
SINGAPORE,"A waterfall, or if that’s not possible, a fountain"
SINGAPORE,rising and falling.
SINGAPORE,"A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem."
SINGAPORE,When the woman turned I could not answer her face.
SINGAPORE,"Her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together, and"
SINGAPORE,neither could win.
SINGAPORE,She smiled and I smiled. What kind of nonsense is this?
SINGAPORE,Everybody needs a job.
SINGAPORE,"Yes, a person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem."
SINGAPORE,"But first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor,"
SINGAPORE,which is dull enough.
SINGAPORE,"She is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays, as big as"
SINGAPORE,"hubcaps, with a blue rag."
SINGAPORE,"Her small hands turn the metal, scrubbing and rinsing."
SINGAPORE,"She does not work slowly, nor quickly, but like a river."
SINGAPORE,Her dark hair is like the wing of a bird.
SINGAPORE,I don’t doubt for a moment that she loves her life.
SINGAPORE,And I want her to rise up from the crust and the slop
SINGAPORE,and fly down to the river.
SINGAPORE,This probably won’t happen.
SINGAPORE,But maybe it will.
SINGAPORE,"If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?"
SINGAPORE,"Of course, it isn’t."
SINGAPORE,"Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only"
SINGAPORE,the light that can shine out of a life. I mean
SINGAPORE,"the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth,"
SINGAPORE,the way her smile was only for my sake; I mean
SINGAPORE,"the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds."
SKUNK CABBAGE,And now as the iron rinds over
SKUNK CABBAGE,"the ponds start dissolving,"
SKUNK CABBAGE,"you come, dreaming of ferns and flowers"
SKUNK CABBAGE,"and new leaves unfolding,"
SKUNK CABBAGE,upon the brash
SKUNK CABBAGE,turnip-hearted skunk cabbage
SKUNK CABBAGE,slinging its bunched leaves up
SKUNK CABBAGE,through the chilly mud.
SKUNK CABBAGE,You kneel beside it. The smell
SKUNK CABBAGE,is lurid and flows out in the most
SKUNK CABBAGE,"unabashed way, attracting"
SKUNK CABBAGE,into itself a continual spattering
SKUNK CABBAGE,of protein. Appalling its rough
SKUNK CABBAGE,"green caves, and the thought"
SKUNK CABBAGE,"of the thick root nested below, stubborn"
SKUNK CABBAGE,and powerful as instinct!
SKUNK CABBAGE,"But these are the woods you love,"
SKUNK CABBAGE,where the secret name
SKUNK CABBAGE,of every death is life again—a miracle
SKUNK CABBAGE,wrought surely not of mere turning
SKUNK CABBAGE,but of dense and scalding reenactment. Not
SKUNK CABBAGE,"tenderness, not longing, but daring and brawn"
SKUNK CABBAGE,"pull down the frozen waterfall, the past."
SKUNK CABBAGE,"Ferns, leaves, flowers, the last subtle"
SKUNK CABBAGE,"refinements, elegant and easeful, wait"
SKUNK CABBAGE,to rise and flourish.
SKUNK CABBAGE,What blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty.
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,I thought the earth
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"remembered me, she"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"took me back so tenderly, arranging"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"her dark skirts, her pockets"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,full of lichens and seeds. I slept
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"as never before, a stone"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"on the riverbed, nothing"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,between me and the white fire of the stars
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"but my thoughts, and they floated"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,light as moths among the branches
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,of the perfect trees. All night
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,I heard the small kingdoms breathing
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"around me, the insects, and the birds"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,who do their work in the darkness. All night
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,"I rose and fell, as if in water, grappling"
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,with a luminous doom. By morning
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,I had vanished at least a dozen times
SLEEPING IN THE FOREST,into something better.
SNAKES IN WINTER,"Deep in the woods,"
SNAKES IN WINTER,"under the sprawled upheavals of rocks,"
SNAKES IN WINTER,dozens lie coiled together.
SNAKES IN WINTER,Touch them: they scarcely
SNAKES IN WINTER,breathe; they stare
SNAKES IN WINTER,out of such deep forgetfulness
SNAKES IN WINTER,that their eyes are like jewels—
SNAKES IN WINTER,"and asleep, though they cannot close."
SNAKES IN WINTER,"And in each mouth the forked tongue,"
SNAKES IN WINTER,"sensitive as an angel’s ear,"
SNAKES IN WINTER,lies like a drugged muscle.
SNAKES IN WINTER,With the fires of spring they will lash forth again
SNAKES IN WINTER,on their life of ribs!—
SNAKES IN WINTER,bodies like whips!
SNAKES IN WINTER,But now under the lids of the mute
SNAKES IN WINTER,succeeding snowfalls
SNAKES IN WINTER,they sleep in their cold cauldron: a flickering broth
SNAKES IN WINTER,six months below simmer.
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"Softest of mornings, hello."
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"And what will you do today, I wonder,"
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,to my heart?
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"And how much honey can the heart stand, I wonder,"
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,before it must break?
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"This is trivial, or nothing: a snail"
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,climbing a trellis of leaves
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,and the blue trumpets of its flowers.
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,No doubt clocks are ticking loudly
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,all over the world.
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,I don’t hear them. The snail’s pale horns
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,extend and wave this way and that
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"as her finger-body shuffles forward, leaving behind"
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,the silvery path of her slime.
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"Oh, softest of mornings, how shall I break this?"
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"How shall I move away from the snail, and the flowers?"
SOFTEST OF MORNINGS,"How shall I go on, with my introspective and ambitious life?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Is the soul solid, like iron?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Or is it tender and breakable, like"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,the wings of a moth in the beak of the owl?
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Who has it, and who doesn’t?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,I keep looking around me.
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,The face of the moose is as sad
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,as the face of Jesus.
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,The swan opens her white wings slowly.
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"In the fall, the black bear carries leaves into the darkness."
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,One question leads to another.
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,Does it have a shape? Like an iceberg?
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,Like the eye of a hummingbird?
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Does it have one lung, like the snake and the scallop?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Why should I have it, and not the anteater"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,who loves her children?
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Why should l have it, and not the camel?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"Come to think of it, what about the maple trees?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,What about the blue iris?
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"What about all the little stones, sitting alone in the moonlight?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,"What about roses, and lemons, and their shining leaves?"
SOME QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT ASK,What about the grass?
SONG FOR AUTUMN,In the deep fall
SONG FOR AUTUMN,don’t you imagine the leaves think how
SONG FOR AUTUMN,comfortable it will be to touch
SONG FOR AUTUMN,the earth instead of the
SONG FOR AUTUMN,nothingness of air and the endless
SONG FOR AUTUMN,freshets of wind? And don’t you think
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"the trees themselves, especially those with mossy,"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"warm caves, begin to think"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"of the birds that will come—six, a dozen—to sleep"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,inside their bodies? And don’t you hear
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"the goldenrod whispering goodbye,"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,the everlasting being crowned with the first
SONG FOR AUTUMN,tuffets of snow? The pond
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"vanishes, and the white field over which"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,the fox runs so quickly brings out
SONG FOR AUTUMN,its blue shadows. And the wind pumps its
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"bellows. And at evening especially,"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,"the piled firewood shifts a little,"
SONG FOR AUTUMN,longing to be on its way.
SPRING,All day the flicker
SPRING,has anticipated
SPRING,"the lust of the season, by"
SPRING,shouting. He scouts up
SPRING,tree after tree and at
SPRING,a certain place begins
SPRING,"to cry out. My, in his"
SPRING,"black-freckled vest, bay body with"
SPRING,red trim and sudden chrome
SPRING,"underwings, he is"
SPRING,dapper. Of course somebody
SPRING,listening nearby
SPRING,hears him; she answers
SPRING,with a sound like hysterical
SPRING,"laughter, and rushes out into"
SPRING,the field where he is poised
SPRING,"on an old phone pole, his head"
SPRING,"swinging, his wings"
SPRING,opening and shutting in a kind of
SPRING,butterfly stroke. She can’t
SPRING,resist; they touch; they flutter.
SPRING,"How lightly, altogether, they accept"
SPRING,"the great task, of carrying life"
SPRING,forward! In the crown of an oak
SPRING,they choose a small tree-cave
SPRING,which they enter with sudden quietness
SPRING,"and modesty. And, for a while,"
SPRING,the wind that can be
SPRING,"a knife or a hammer, subsides."
SPRING,They listen
SPRING,to the thrushes.
SPRING,"The sky is blue, or the rain"
SPRING,falls with its spills of pearl.
SPRING,Around their wreath of darkness
SPRING,the leaves of the world unfurl.
STONES,"The white stones were mountains, then they went traveling."
STONES,The pink stones also were part of a mountain before
STONES,the glacier’s tongue gathered them up.
STONES,Now they lie resting under the waves.
STONES,"The green stones are lovelier than the blue stones, I thought"
STONES,"for a little while,"
STONES,then I changed my mind.
STONES,Stones born of the sediments tell what ooze floated down
STONES,the outwash once.
STONES,"Stones born of the fire have red stars inside their bodies,"
STONES,and seams of white quartz.
STONES,"Also I admire the heft, and the circularities"
STONES,as they lie without wrists or ankles just under the water.
STONES,Also I imagine how they lie quietly all night
STONES,"under the moon and whatever passes overhead—say, the floating"
STONES,lily of the night-heron.
STONES,It is apparent also how they lie relaxed under the sun’s
STONES,golden ladders.
STONES,Each one is a slow-wheeler.
STONES,"Each one is a tiny church, locked up tight."
STONES,Each one is perfect—but none of them is ready quite yet
STONES,"to come to the garden, to raise corn"
STONES,or the bulb of the iris.
STONES,If I lived inland I would want to take one or two home with me
STONES,"just to look at in that long life of dust and grass,"
STONES,but I hope I wouldn’t.
STONES,"I hope I wouldn’t take even one like a seed from the sunflower’s face,"
STONES,like an ant’s white egg from the warm nursery under the hill.
STONES,"I hope I would leave them, in the perfect balance of things,"
STONES,in the clear body of the sea
SWAN,"Did you too see it, drifting, all night on the black river?"
SWAN,"Did you see it in the morning, rising into the silvery air,"
SWAN,"an armful of white blossoms,"
SWAN,a perfect commotion of silk and linen as it leaned
SWAN,"into the bondage of its wings: a snowbank, a bank of lilies,"
SWAN,biting the air with its black beak?
SWAN,"Did you hear it, fluting and whistling"
SWAN,"a shrill dark music, like the rain pelting the trees,"
SWAN,like a waterfall
SWAN,knifing down the black ledges?
SWAN,"And did you see it, finally, just under the clouds—"
SWAN,"a white cross streaming across the sky, its feet"
SWAN,"like black leaves, its wings like the stretching light"
SWAN,of the river?
SWAN,"And did you feel it, in your heart, how it pertained to everything?"
SWAN,And have you too finally figured out what beauty is for?
SWAN,And have you changed your life?
TECUMSEH,I went down not long ago
TECUMSEH,"to the Mad River, under the willows"
TECUMSEH,"I knelt and drank from that crumpled flow, call it"
TECUMSEH,"what madness you will, there’s a sickness"
TECUMSEH,worse than the risk of death and that’s
TECUMSEH,forgetting what we should never forget.
TECUMSEH,Tecumseh lived here.
TECUMSEH,The wounds of the past
TECUMSEH,"are ignored, but hang on"
TECUMSEH,"like the litter that snags among the yellow branches,"
TECUMSEH,"newspapers and plastic bags, after the rains."
TECUMSEH,Where are the Shawnee now?
TECUMSEH,Do you know? Or would you have to
TECUMSEH,"write to Washington, and even then,"
TECUMSEH,"whatever they said,"
TECUMSEH,would you believe it? Sometimes
TECUMSEH,I would like to paint my body red and go out into
TECUMSEH,the glittering snow
TECUMSEH,to die.
TECUMSEH,His name meant Shooting Star.
TECUMSEH,From Mad River country north to the border
TECUMSEH,he gathered the tribes
TECUMSEH,and armed them one more time. He vowed
TECUMSEH,to keep Ohio and it took him
TECUMSEH,over twenty years to fail.
TECUMSEH,"After the bloody and final fighting, at Thames,"
TECUMSEH,"it was over, except"
TECUMSEH,his body could not be found.
TECUMSEH,"It was never found,"
TECUMSEH,"and you can do whatever you want with that, say"
TECUMSEH,his people came in the black leaves of the night
TECUMSEH,"and hauled him to a secret grave, or that"
TECUMSEH,"he turned into a little boy again, and leaped"
TECUMSEH,into a birch canoe and went
TECUMSEH,"rowing home down the rivers. Anyway,"
TECUMSEH,"this much I’m sure of: if we ever meet him, we’ll know it,"
TECUMSEH,he will still be
TECUMSEH,so angry.
TERNS,"Don’t think just now of the trudging forward of thought,"
TERNS,but of the wing-drive of unquestioning affirmation.
TERNS,"It’s summer, you never saw such a blue sky,"
TERNS,"and here they are, those white birds with quick wings,"
TERNS,"sweeping over the waves,"
TERNS,"chattering and plunging,"
TERNS,"their thin beaks snapping, their hard eyes"
TERNS,happy as little nails.
TERNS,The years to come—this is a promise—
TERNS,will grant you ample time
TERNS,to try the difficult steps in the empire of thought
TERNS,where you seek for the shining proofs you think you must have.
TERNS,"But nothing you ever understand will be sweeter, or more binding,"
TERNS,than this deepest affinity between your eyes and the world.
TERNS,The flock thickens
TERNS,"over the roiling, salt brightness. Listen,"
TERNS,"maybe such devotion, in which one holds the world"
TERNS,"in the clasp of attention, isn’t the perfect prayer,"
TERNS,"but it must be close, for the sorrow, whose name is doubt,"
TERNS,"is thus subdued, and not through the weaponry of reason,"
TERNS,"but of pure submission. Tell me, what else"
TERNS,could beauty be for? And now the tide
TERNS,"is at its very crown,"
TERNS,"the white birds sprinkle down,"
TERNS,"gathering up the loose silver, rising"
TERNS,"as if weightless. It isn’t instruction, or a parable."
TERNS,It isn’t for any vanity or ambition
TERNS,"except for the one allowed, to stay alive."
TERNS,It’s only a nimble frolic
TERNS,"over the waves. And you find, for hours,"
TERNS,you cannot even remember the questions
TERNS,that weigh so in your mind.
THE ARROWHEAD,"The arrowhead,"
THE ARROWHEAD,"which I found beside the river,"
THE ARROWHEAD,was glittering and pointed.
THE ARROWHEAD,"I picked it up, and said,"
THE ARROWHEAD,"Now, it’s mine."
THE ARROWHEAD,I thought of showing it to friends.
THE ARROWHEAD,I thought of putting it—such an imposing trinket—
THE ARROWHEAD,"in a little box, on my desk."
THE ARROWHEAD,"Halfway home, past the cut fields,"
THE ARROWHEAD,the old ghost
THE ARROWHEAD,stood under the hickories.
THE ARROWHEAD,"I would rather drink the wind, he said,"
THE ARROWHEAD,I would rather eat mud and die
THE ARROWHEAD,"than steal as you still steal,"
THE ARROWHEAD,than lie as you still lie.
THE BLACK SNAKE,When the black snake
THE BLACK SNAKE,"flashed onto the morning road,"
THE BLACK SNAKE,and the truck could not swerve—
THE BLACK SNAKE,"death, that is how it happens."
THE BLACK SNAKE,Now he lies looped and useless
THE BLACK SNAKE,as an old bicycle tire.
THE BLACK SNAKE,I stop the car
THE BLACK SNAKE,and carry him into the bushes.
THE BLACK SNAKE,He is as cool and gleaming
THE BLACK SNAKE,"as a braided whip, he is as beautiful and quiet"
THE BLACK SNAKE,as a dead brother.
THE BLACK SNAKE,I leave him under the leaves
THE BLACK SNAKE,"and drive on, thinking"
THE BLACK SNAKE,"about death: its suddenness,"
THE BLACK SNAKE,"its terrible weight,"
THE BLACK SNAKE,its certain coming. Yet under
THE BLACK SNAKE,"reason burns a brighter fire, which the bones"
THE BLACK SNAKE,have always preferred.
THE BLACK SNAKE,It is the story of endless good fortune.
THE BLACK SNAKE,It says to oblivion: not me!
THE BLACK SNAKE,It is the light at the center of every cell.
THE BLACK SNAKE,It is what sent the snake coiling and flowing forward
THE BLACK SNAKE,happily all spring through the green leaves before
THE BLACK SNAKE,he came to the road.
THE DIPPER,Once I saw
THE DIPPER,"in a quick-falling, white-veined stream,"
THE DIPPER,"among the leafed islands of the wet rocks,"
THE DIPPER,"a small bird, and knew it"
THE DIPPER,from the pages of a book; it was
THE DIPPER,"the dipper, and dipping he was,"
THE DIPPER,"as well as, sometimes, on a rock-peak, starting up"
THE DIPPER,"the clear, strong pipe of his voice; at this,"
THE DIPPER,"there being no words to transcribe, I had to"
THE DIPPER,"bend forward, as it were,"
THE DIPPER,"into his frame of mind, catching"
THE DIPPER,"everything I could in the tone,"
THE DIPPER,"cadence, sweetness, and briskness"
THE DIPPER,of his affirmative report.
THE DIPPER,"Though not by words, it was"
THE DIPPER,a more than satisfactory way to the
THE DIPPER,bridge of understanding. This happened
THE DIPPER,in Colorado
THE DIPPER,more than half a century ago—
THE DIPPER,"more, certainly, than half my lifetime ago—"
THE DIPPER,"and, just as certainly, he has been sleeping for decades"
THE DIPPER,"in the leaves beside the stream,"
THE DIPPER,"his crumble of white bones, his curl of flesh"
THE DIPPER,comfortable even so.
THE DIPPER,And still I hear him—
THE DIPPER,and whenever I open the ponderous book of riddles
THE DIPPER,"he sits with his black feet hooked to the page,"
THE DIPPER,"his eyes cheerful, still burning with water-love—"
THE DIPPER,"and thus the world is full of leaves and feathers,"
THE DIPPER,"and comfort, and instruction. I do not even remember"
THE DIPPER,"your name, great river,"
THE DIPPER,but since that hour I have lived
THE DIPPER,"simply,"
THE DIPPER,in the joy of the body as full and clear
THE DIPPER,as falling water; the pleasures of the mind
THE DIPPER,"like a dark bird dipping in and out, tasting and singing."
THE FISH,The first fish
THE FISH,I ever caught
THE FISH,would not lie down
THE FISH,quiet in the pail
THE FISH,but flailed and sucked
THE FISH,at the burning
THE FISH,amazement of the air
THE FISH,and died
THE FISH,in the slow pouring off
THE FISH,of rainbows. Later
THE FISH,I opened his body and separated
THE FISH,the flesh from the bones
THE FISH,and ate him. Now the sea
THE FISH,"is in me: I am the fish, the fish"
THE FISH,glitters in me; we are
THE FISH,"risen, tangled together, certain to fall"
THE FISH,"back to the sea. Out of pain,"
THE FISH,"and pain, and more pain"
THE FISH,"we feed this feverish plot, we are nourished"
THE FISH,by the mystery.
THE GIFT,"Be still, my soul, and steadfast."
THE GIFT,Earth and heaven both are still watching
THE GIFT,though time is draining from the clock
THE GIFT,"and your walk, that was confident and quick,"
THE GIFT,has become slow.
THE GIFT,"So, be slow if you must, but let"
THE GIFT,the heart still play its true part.
THE GIFT,"Love still as once you loved, deeply"
THE GIFT,and without patience. Let God and the world
THE GIFT,know you are grateful.
THE GIFT,That the gift has been given.
THE HERMIT CRAB,Once I looked inside
THE HERMIT CRAB,the darkness
THE HERMIT CRAB,"of a shell folded like a pastry,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,and there was a fancy face—
THE HERMIT CRAB,or almost a face—
THE HERMIT CRAB,it turned away
THE HERMIT CRAB,and frisked up its brawny forearms
THE HERMIT CRAB,so quickly
THE HERMIT CRAB,against the light
THE HERMIT CRAB,and my looking in
THE HERMIT CRAB,"I scarcely had time to see it,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,gleaming
THE HERMIT CRAB,under the pure white roof
THE HERMIT CRAB,of old calcium.
THE HERMIT CRAB,"When I set it down, it hurried"
THE HERMIT CRAB,along the tideline
THE HERMIT CRAB,"of the sea,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,"which was slashing along as usual,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,shouting and hissing
THE HERMIT CRAB,"toward the future,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,turning its back
THE HERMIT CRAB,"with every tide on the past,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,leaving the shore littered
THE HERMIT CRAB,every morning
THE HERMIT CRAB,with more ornaments of death—
THE HERMIT CRAB,what a pearly rubble
THE HERMIT CRAB,from which to choose a house
THE HERMIT CRAB,like a white flower—
THE HERMIT CRAB,and what a rebellion
THE HERMIT CRAB,to leap into it
THE HERMIT CRAB,"and hold on,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,"connecting everything,"
THE HERMIT CRAB,the past to the future—
THE HERMIT CRAB,which is of course the miracle—
THE HERMIT CRAB,which is the only argument there is
THE HERMIT CRAB,against the sea.
THE KINGFISHER,The kingfisher rises out of the black wave
THE KINGFISHER,"like a blue flower, in his beak"
THE KINGFISHER,he carries a silver leaf. I think this is
THE KINGFISHER,the prettiest world—so long as you don’t mind
THE KINGFISHER,"a little dying, how could there be a day in your whole life"
THE KINGFISHER,that doesn’t have its splash of happiness?
THE KINGFISHER,There are more fish than there are leaves
THE KINGFISHER,"on a thousand trees, and anyway the kingfisher"
THE KINGFISHER,"wasn’t born to think about it, or anything else."
THE KINGFISHER,"When the wave snaps shut over his blue head, the water"
THE KINGFISHER,remains water—hunger is the only story
THE KINGFISHER,he has ever heard in his life that he could believe.
THE KINGFISHER,I don’t say he’s right. Neither
THE KINGFISHER,do I say he’s wrong. Religiously he swallows the silver leaf
THE KINGFISHER,"with its broken red river, and with a rough and easy cry"
THE KINGFISHER,I couldn’t rouse out of my thoughtful body
THE KINGFISHER,"if my life depended on it, he swings back"
THE KINGFISHER,"over the bright sea to do the same thing, to do it"
THE KINGFISHER,"(as I long to do something, anything) perfectly."
THE KITTEN,More amazed than anything
THE KITTEN,I took the perfectly black
THE KITTEN,stillborn kitten
THE KITTEN,with the one large eye
THE KITTEN,in the center of its small forehead
THE KITTEN,from the house cat’s bed
THE KITTEN,and buried it in a field
THE KITTEN,behind the house.
THE KITTEN,I suppose I could have given it
THE KITTEN,"to a museum,"
THE KITTEN,I could have called the local
THE KITTEN,newspaper.
THE KITTEN,But instead I took it out into the field
THE KITTEN,and opened the earth
THE KITTEN,and put it back
THE KITTEN,"saying, it was real,"
THE KITTEN,"saying, life is infinitely inventive,"
THE KITTEN,"saying, what other amazements"
THE KITTEN,"lie in the dark seed of the earth, yes,"
THE KITTEN,I think I did right to go out alone
THE KITTEN,"and give it back peacefully, and cover the place"
THE KITTEN,with the reckless blossoms of weeds.
THE KOOKABURRAS,In every heart there is a coward and a procrastinator.
THE KOOKABURRAS,"In every heart there is a god of flowers, just waiting"
THE KOOKABURRAS,to come out of its cloud and lift its wings.
THE KOOKABURRAS,"The kookaburras, kingfishers, pressed against the edge of"
THE KOOKABURRAS,"their cage, they asked me to open the door."
THE KOOKABURRAS,"Years later I wake in the night and remember how I said to them,"
THE KOOKABURRAS,"no, and walked away."
THE KOOKABURRAS,They had the brown eyes of soft-hearted dogs.
THE KOOKABURRAS,"They didn’t want to do anything so extraordinary, only to fly"
THE KOOKABURRAS,home to their river.
THE KOOKABURRAS,By now I suppose the great darkness has covered them.
THE KOOKABURRAS,"As for myself, I am not yet a god of even the palest flowers."
THE KOOKABURRAS,Nothing else has changed either.
THE KOOKABURRAS,Someone tosses their white bones to the dung-heap.
THE KOOKABURRAS,The sun shines on the latch of their cage.
THE KOOKABURRAS,"I lie in the dark, my heart pounding."
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,"cries for three days, in the gray mist."
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,cries for the north it hopes it can find.
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,"plunges, and comes up with a slapping pickerel."
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,blinks its red eye.
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,cries again.
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,"you come every afternoon, and wait to hear it."
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,"you sit a long time, quiet, under the thick pines,"
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,in the silence that follows.
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,as though it were your own twilight.
THE LOON ON OAK-HEAD POND,as though it were your own vanishing song.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"Passing by, he could be anybody:"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"A thief, a tradesman, a doctor"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,On his way to a worried house.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"But when he stops at your gate,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"Under the room where you lie half-asleep,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,You know it is not just anyone—
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,It is the Night Traveler.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,You lean your arms on the sill
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,And stare down. But all you can see
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Are bits of wilderness attached to him—
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"Twigs, loam and leaves,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Vines and blossoms. Among these
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"You feel his eyes, and his hands"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Lifting something in the air.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"He has a gift for you, but it has no name."
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,It is windy and woolly.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"He holds it in the moonlight, and it sings"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"Like a newborn beast,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"Like a child at Christmas,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Like your own heart as it tumbles
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,In love’s green bed.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"You take it, and he is gone."
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"All night—and all your life, if you are willing—"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"It will nuzzle your face, cold-nosed,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Like a small white wolf;
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,It will curl in your palm
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Like a hard blue stone;
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,It will liquefy into a cold pool
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,"Which, when you dive into it,"
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,Will hold you like a mossy jaw.
THE NIGHT TRAVELER,A bath of light. An answer.
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,"The sea can do craziness, it can do smooth,"
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,it can lie down like silk breathing
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,or toss havoc shoreward; it can give
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,"gifts or withhold all; it can rise, ebb, froth"
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,"like an incoming frenzy of fountains, or it can"
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,"sweet-talk entirely. As I can too,"
THE POET COMPARES HUMAN NATURE TO THE OCEAN FROM WHICH WE CAME,"and so, no doubt, can you, and you."
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,You want to cry aloud for your
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,mistakes. But to tell the truth the world
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,doesn’t need any more of that sound.
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,So if you’re going to do it and can’t
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"stop yourself, if your pretty mouth can’t"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"hold it in, at least go by yourself across"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,the forty fields and the forty dark inclines
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,of rocks and water to the place where
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,the falls are flinging out their white sheets
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"like crazy, and there is a cave behind all that"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,jubilation and water-fun and you can
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"stand there, under it, and roar all you"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,want and nothing will be disturbed; you can
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"drip with despair all afternoon and still,"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"on a green branch, its wings just lightly touched"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"by the passing foil of the water, the thrush,"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"puffing out its spotted breast, will sing"
THE POET WITH HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS,"of the perfect, stone-hard beauty of everything."
THE POND,"August of another summer, and once again"
THE POND,I am drinking the sun
THE POND,and the lilies again are spread across the water.
THE POND,I know now what they want is to touch each other.
THE POND,I have not been here for many years
THE POND,during which time I kept living my life.
THE POND,"Like the heron, who can only croak, who wishes he"
THE POND,"could sing,"
THE POND,I wish I could sing.
THE POND,A little thanks from every throat would be appropriate.
THE POND,"This is how it has been, and this is how it is:"
THE POND,"All my life I have been able to feel happiness,"
THE POND,"except whatever was not happiness,"
THE POND,which I also remember.
THE POND,Each of us wears a shadow.
THE POND,But just now it is summer again
THE POND,"and I am watching the lilies bow to each other,"
THE POND,"then slide on the wind and the tug of desire,"
THE POND,"close, close to one another."
THE POND,"Soon now, I’ll turn and start for home."
THE POND,"And who knows, maybe I’ll be singing."
THE RABBIT,"Scatterghost,"
THE RABBIT,it can’t float away.
THE RABBIT,"And the rain, everybody’s brother,"
THE RABBIT,won’t help. And the wind all these days
THE RABBIT,flying like ten crazy sisters everywhere
THE RABBIT,"can’t seem to do a thing. No one but me,"
THE RABBIT,"and my hands like fire,"
THE RABBIT,to lift him to a last burrow. I wait
THE RABBIT,"days, while the body opens and begins"
THE RABBIT,to boil. I remember
THE RABBIT,"the leaping in the moonlight, and can’t touch it,"
THE RABBIT,wanting it miraculously to heal
THE RABBIT,and spring up
THE RABBIT,joyful. But finally
THE RABBIT,I do. And the day after I’ve shoveled
THE RABBIT,"the earth over, in a field nearby"
THE RABBIT,I find a small bird’s nest lined pale
THE RABBIT,and silvery and the chicks—
THE RABBIT,"are you listening, death?—warm in the rabbit’s fur."
THE ROSES,One day in summer
THE ROSES,when everything
THE ROSES,has already been more than enough
THE ROSES,the wild beds start
THE ROSES,exploding open along the berm
THE ROSES,of the sea; day after day
THE ROSES,you sit near them; day after day
THE ROSES,the honey keeps on coming
THE ROSES,in the red cups and the bees
THE ROSES,like amber drops roll
THE ROSES,"in the petals: there is no end,"
THE ROSES,"believe me! to the inventions of summer,"
THE ROSES,to the happiness your body
THE ROSES,is willing to bear.
THE STORM,Now through the white orchard my little dog
THE STORM,"romps, breaking the new snow"
THE STORM,with wild feet.
THE STORM,"Running here running there, excited,"
THE STORM,"hardly able to stop, he leaps, he spins"
THE STORM,until the white snow is written upon
THE STORM,"in large, exuberant letters,"
THE STORM,"a long sentence, expressing"
THE STORM,the pleasures of the body in this world.
THE SUMMER DAY,Who made the world?
THE SUMMER DAY,"Who made the swan, and the black bear?"
THE SUMMER DAY,Who made the grasshopper?
THE SUMMER DAY,"This grasshopper, I mean—"
THE SUMMER DAY,"the one who has flung herself out of the grass,"
THE SUMMER DAY,"the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,"
THE SUMMER DAY,who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down—
THE SUMMER DAY,who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.
THE SUMMER DAY,Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.
THE SUMMER DAY,"Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away."
THE SUMMER DAY,I don’t know exactly what a prayer is.
THE SUMMER DAY,"I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down"
THE SUMMER DAY,"into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,"
THE SUMMER DAY,"how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,"
THE SUMMER DAY,which is what I have been doing all day.
THE SUMMER DAY,"Tell me, what else should I have done?"
THE SUMMER DAY,"Doesn’t everything die at last, and too soon?"
THE SUMMER DAY,"Tell me, what is it you plan to do"
THE SUMMER DAY,with your one wild and precious life?
THE SUN,Have you ever seen
THE SUN,anything
THE SUN,in your life
THE SUN,more wonderful
THE SUN,"than the way the sun,"
THE SUN,"every evening,"
THE SUN,"relaxed and easy,"
THE SUN,floats toward the horizon
THE SUN,"and into the clouds or the hills,"
THE SUN,"or the rumpled sea,"
THE SUN,and is gone—
THE SUN,and how it slides again
THE SUN,"out of the blackness,"
THE SUN,"every morning,"
THE SUN,"on the other side of the world,"
THE SUN,like a red flower
THE SUN,"streaming upward on its heavenly oils,"
THE SUN,"say, on a morning in early summer,"
THE SUN,at its perfect imperial distance—
THE SUN,and have you ever felt for anything
THE SUN,such wild love—
THE SUN,"do you think there is anywhere, in any language,"
THE SUN,a word billowing enough
THE SUN,for the pleasure
THE SUN,"that fills you,"
THE SUN,as the sun
THE SUN,"reaches out,"
THE SUN,as it warms you
THE SUN,"as you stand there,"
THE SUN,empty-handed—
THE SUN,or have you too
THE SUN,turned from this world—
THE SUN,or have you too
THE SUN,gone crazy
THE SUN,"for power,"
THE SUN,for things?
THE SUNFLOWERS,Come with me
THE SUNFLOWERS,into the field of sunflowers.
THE SUNFLOWERS,"Their faces are burnished disks,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,their dry spines
THE SUNFLOWERS,"creak like ship masts,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"their green leaves,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"so heavy and many,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,fill all day with the sticky
THE SUNFLOWERS,sugars of the sun.
THE SUNFLOWERS,Come with me
THE SUNFLOWERS,"to visit the sunflowers,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,they are shy
THE SUNFLOWERS,but want to be friends;
THE SUNFLOWERS,they have wonderful stories
THE SUNFLOWERS,of when they were young—
THE SUNFLOWERS,"the important weather,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,the wandering crows.
THE SUNFLOWERS,Don’t be afraid
THE SUNFLOWERS,to ask them questions!
THE SUNFLOWERS,"Their bright faces,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"which follow the sun,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"will listen, and all"
THE SUNFLOWERS,those rows of seeds—
THE SUNFLOWERS,each one a new life!—
THE SUNFLOWERS,hope for a deeper acquaintance;
THE SUNFLOWERS,"each of them, though it stands"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"in a crowd of many,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"like a separate universe,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"is lonely, the long work"
THE SUNFLOWERS,of turning their lives
THE SUNFLOWERS,into a celebration
THE SUNFLOWERS,is not easy. Come
THE SUNFLOWERS,"and let us talk with those modest faces,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,"the simple garments of leaves,"
THE SUNFLOWERS,the coarse roots in the earth
THE SUNFLOWERS,so uprightly burning.
THE SWAN,Across the wide waters
THE SWAN,something comes
THE SWAN,floating—a slim
THE SWAN,and delicate
THE SWAN,"ship, filled"
THE SWAN,with white flowers—
THE SWAN,and it moves
THE SWAN,on its miraculous muscles
THE SWAN,"as though time didn’t exist,"
THE SWAN,as though bringing such gifts
THE SWAN,to the dry shore
THE SWAN,was a happiness
THE SWAN,almost beyond bearing.
THE SWAN,"And now it turns its dark eyes,"
THE SWAN,it rearranges
THE SWAN,"the clouds of its wings,"
THE SWAN,it trails
THE SWAN,"an elaborate webbed foot,"
THE SWAN,the color of charcoal.
THE SWAN,Soon it will be here.
THE SWAN,"Oh, what shall I do"
THE SWAN,when that poppy-colored beak
THE SWAN,rests in my hand?
THE SWAN,Said Mrs. Blake of the poet:
THE SWAN,I miss my husband’s company—
THE SWAN,he is so often
THE SWAN,in paradise.
THE SWAN,Of course! the path to heaven
THE SWAN,doesn’t lie down in flat miles.
THE SWAN,It’s in the imagination
THE SWAN,with which you perceive
THE SWAN,"this world,"
THE SWAN,and the gestures
THE SWAN,with which you honor it.
THE SWAN,"Oh, what will I do, what will I say, when those white wings"
THE SWAN,touch the shore?
THE TRURO BEAR,There’s a bear in the Truro woods.
THE TRURO BEAR,"People have seen it—three or four,"
THE TRURO BEAR,"or two, or one. I think"
THE TRURO BEAR,of the thickness of the serious woods
THE TRURO BEAR,around the dark bowls of the Truro ponds;
THE TRURO BEAR,"I think of the blueberry fields, the blackberry tangles,"
THE TRURO BEAR,the cranberry bogs. And the sky
THE TRURO BEAR,"with its new moon, its familiar star-trails,"
THE TRURO BEAR,"burns down like a brand-new heaven,"
THE TRURO BEAR,while everywhere I look on the scratchy hillsides
THE TRURO BEAR,shadows seem to grow shoulders. Surely
THE TRURO BEAR,"a beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly"
THE TRURO BEAR,"through the woods for years, learning to stay away"
THE TRURO BEAR,from roads and houses. Common sense mutters:
THE TRURO BEAR,"it can’t be true, it must be somebody’s"
THE TRURO BEAR,runaway dog. But the seed
THE TRURO BEAR,"has been planted, and when has happiness ever"
THE TRURO BEAR,required much evidence to begin
THE TRURO BEAR,its leaf-green breathing?
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,I have refused to live
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,locked in the orderly house of
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,reasons and proofs.
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,The world I live in and believe in
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,"is wider than that. And anyway,"
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,what’s wrong with Maybe?
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,You wouldn’t believe what once or
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,twice I have seen. I’ll just
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,tell you this:
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,only if there are angels in your head will you
THE WORLD I LIVE IN,"ever, possibly, see one."
THIS MORNING,This morning the redbirds’ eggs
THIS MORNING,have hatched and already the chicks
THIS MORNING,are chirping for food. They don’t
THIS MORNING,"know where it’s coming from, they"
THIS MORNING,"just keep shouting, More! More!"
THIS MORNING,"As to anything else, they haven’t"
THIS MORNING,had a single thought. Their eyes
THIS MORNING,"haven’t yet opened, they know nothing"
THIS MORNING,about the sky that’s waiting. Or
THIS MORNING,"the thousands, the millions of trees."
THIS MORNING,They don’t even know they have wings.
THIS MORNING,"And just like that, like a simple"
THIS MORNING,"neighborhood event, a miracle is"
THIS MORNING,taking place.
TIDES,Every day the sea
TIDES,blue gray green lavender
TIDES,pulls away leaving the harbor’s
TIDES,dark-cobbled undercoat
TIDES,"slick and rutted and worm-riddled, the gulls"
TIDES,"walk there among old whalebones, the white"
TIDES,spines of fish blink from the strandy stew
TIDES,as the hours tick over; and then
TIDES,"far out the faint, sheer"
TIDES,"line turns, rustling over the slack,"
TIDES,"the outer bars, over the green-furred flats, over"
TIDES,"the clam beds, slippery logs,"
TIDES,"barnacle-studded stones, dragging"
TIDES,"the shining sheets forward, deepening,"
TIDES,"pushing, wreathing together"
TIDES,"wave and seaweed, their piled curvatures"
TIDES,"spilling over themselves, lapping"
TIDES,"blue gray green lavender, never"
TIDES,"resting, not ever but fashioning shore,"
TIDES,"continent, everything."
TIDES,And here you may find me
TIDES,on almost any morning
TIDES,walking along the shore so
TIDES,light-footed so casual.
TURTLE,Now I see it—
TURTLE,it nudges with its bulldog head
TURTLE,"the slippery stems of the lilies, making them tremble;"
TURTLE,and now it noses along in the wake of the little brown teal
TURTLE,who is leading her soft children
TURTLE,from one side of the pond to the other; she keeps
TURTLE,close to the edge
TURTLE,"and they follow closely, the good children—"
TURTLE,"the tender children,"
TURTLE,"the sweet children, dangling their pretty feet"
TURTLE,into the darkness.
TURTLE,"And now will come—I can count on it—the murky splash,"
TURTLE,the certain victory
TURTLE,"of that pink and gassy mouth, and the frantic"
TURTLE,circling of the hen while the rest of the chicks
TURTLE,"flare away over the water and into the reeds, and my heart"
TURTLE,will be most mournful
TURTLE,"on their account. But, listen,"
TURTLE,what’s important?
TURTLE,Nothing’s important
TURTLE,"except that the great and cruel mystery of the world,"
TURTLE,"of which this is a part,"
TURTLE,"not be denied. Once,"
TURTLE,"I happened to see, on a city street, in summer,"
TURTLE,"a dusty, fouled turtle plodding along—"
TURTLE,a snapper—
TURTLE,broken out I suppose from some backyard cage—
TURTLE,and I knew what I had to do—
TURTLE,"I looked it right in the eyes, and I caught it—"
TURTLE,"I put it, like a small mountain range,"
TURTLE,"into a knapsack, and I took it out"
TURTLE,"of the city, and I let it"
TURTLE,"down into the dark pond, into"
TURTLE,"the cool water,"
TURTLE,"and the light of the lilies,"
TURTLE,to live.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"Last night the geese came back,"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,slanting fast
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,from the blossom of the rising moon down
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,to the black pond. A muskrat
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,swimming in the twilight saw them and hurried
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,to the secret lodges to tell everyone
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,spring had come.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,And so it had.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,By morning when I went out
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"the last of the ice had disappeared, blackbirds"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,sang on the shores. Every year
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"the geese, returning,"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"do this, I don’t"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,know how.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,The curtains opened and there was
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"an old man in a headdress of feathers,"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,leather leggings and a vest made
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,from the skin of some animal. He danced
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"in a kind of surly rapture, and the trees"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,in the fields far away
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,began to mutter and suck up their long roots.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,Slowly they advanced until they stood
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,pressed to the schoolhouse windows.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,I don’t know
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,lots of things but I know this: next year
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,when spring
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,flows over the starting point I’ll think I’m going to
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,drown in the shimmering miles of it and then
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,one or two birds will fly me over
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,the threshold.
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,As for the pain
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"of others, of course it tries to be"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"abstract, but then"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"there flares up out of a vanished wilderness, like fire,"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,still blistering: the wrinkled face
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,of an old Chippewa
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,"smiling, hating us,"
TWO KINDS OF DELIVERANCE,dancing for his life.
VIOLETS,Down by the rumbling creek and the tall trees—
VIOLETS,where I went truant from school three days a week
VIOLETS,and therefore broke the record—
VIOLETS,there were violets as easy in their lives
VIOLETS,as anything you have ever seen
VIOLETS,or leaned down to intake the sweet breath of.
VIOLETS,"Later, when the necessary houses were built"
VIOLETS,"they were gone, and who would give significance"
VIOLETS,to their absence.
VIOLETS,"Oh, violets, you did signify, and what shall take"
VIOLETS,your place?
WE SHAKE WITH JOY,"We shake with joy, we shake with grief."
WE SHAKE WITH JOY,"What a time they have, these two"
WE SHAKE WITH JOY,housed as they are in the same body.
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,I do not know what gorgeous thing
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,"the bluebird keeps saying,"
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,"his voice easing out of his throat,"
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,"beak, body into the pink air"
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,of the early morning. I like it
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,whatever it is. Sometimes
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,it seems the only thing in the world
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,that is without dark thoughts.
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,Sometimes it seems the only thing
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,in the world that is without
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,questions that can’t and probably
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,"never will be answered, the"
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,only thing that is entirely content
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,"with the pink, then clear white"
WHAT GORGEOUS THING,"morning and, gratefully, says so."
WHELKS,Here are the perfect
WHELKS,"fans of the scallops,"
WHELKS,"quahogs, and weedy mussels"
WHELKS,still holding their orange fruit—
WHELKS,and here are the whelks—
WHELKS,"whirlwinds,"
WHELKS,"each the size of a fist,"
WHELKS,but always cracked and broken—
WHELKS,clearly they have been traveling
WHELKS,under the sky-blue waves
WHELKS,for a long time.
WHELKS,All my life
WHELKS,I have been restless—
WHELKS,I have felt there is something
WHELKS,more wonderful than gloss—
WHELKS,than wholeness—
WHELKS,than staying at home.
WHELKS,I have not been sure what it is.
WHELKS,But every morning on the wide shore
WHELKS,I pass what is perfect and shining
WHELKS,"to look for the whelks, whose edges"
WHELKS,have rubbed so long against the world
WHELKS,they have snapped and crumbled—
WHELKS,"they have almost vanished,"
WHELKS,with the last relinquishing
WHELKS,"of their unrepeatable energy,"
WHELKS,back into everything else.
WHELKS,When I find one
WHELKS,"I hold it in my hand,"
WHELKS,"I look out over that shanking fire,"
WHELKS,"I shut my eyes. Not often,"
WHELKS,but now and again there’s a moment
WHELKS,when the heart cries aloud:
WHELKS,"yes, I am willing to be"
WHELKS,"that wild darkness,"
WHELKS,"that long, blue body of light."
WHEN DEATH COMES,When death comes
WHEN DEATH COMES,like the hungry bear in autumn;
WHEN DEATH COMES,when death comes and takes all the bright coins from his purse
WHEN DEATH COMES,"to buy me, and snaps the purse shut;"
WHEN DEATH COMES,when death comes
WHEN DEATH COMES,like the measle-pox;
WHEN DEATH COMES,when death comes
WHEN DEATH COMES,"like an iceberg between the shoulder blades,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"I want to step through the door full of curiosity, wondering:"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"what is it going to be like, that cottage of darkness?"
WHEN DEATH COMES,And therefore I look upon everything
WHEN DEATH COMES,"as a brotherhood and a sisterhood,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"and I look upon time as no more than an idea,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"and I consider eternity as another possibility,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"and I think of each life as a flower, as common"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"as a field daisy, and as singular,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"and each name a comfortable music in the mouth,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"tending, as all music does, toward silence,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"and each body a lion of courage, and something"
WHEN DEATH COMES,precious to the earth.
WHEN DEATH COMES,"When it’s over, I want to say: all my life"
WHEN DEATH COMES,I was a bride married to amazement.
WHEN DEATH COMES,"I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms."
WHEN DEATH COMES,"When it’s over, I don’t want to wonder"
WHEN DEATH COMES,"if I have made of my life something particular, and real."
WHEN DEATH COMES,"I don’t want to find myself sighing and frightened,"
WHEN DEATH COMES,or full of argument.
WHEN DEATH COMES,I don’t want to end up simply having visited this world.
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"When I am among the trees,"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"especially the willows and the honey locust,"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"equally the beech, the oaks and the pines,"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,they give off such hints of gladness.
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"I would almost say that they save me, and daily."
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"I am so distant from the hope of myself,"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"in which I have goodness, and discernment,"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,and never hurry through the world
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"but walk slowly, and bow often."
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,Around me the trees stir in their leaves
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"and call out, Stay awhile."
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,The light flows from their branches.
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"And they call again, It’s simple, they say,"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,and you too have come
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"into the world to do this, to go easy, to be filled"
WHEN I AM AMONG THE TREES,"with light, and to shine."

"WHERE DOES THE TEMPLE BEGIN, WHERE DOES IT END?",There are things you can’t reach. But

WHISTLING SWANS,Do you bow your head when you pray or do you look
WHISTLING SWANS,up into that blue space?
WHISTLING SWANS,"Take your choice, prayers fly from all directions."
WHISTLING SWANS,"And don’t worry about what language you use,"
WHISTLING SWANS,God no doubt understands them all.
WHISTLING SWANS,Even when the swans are flying north and making
WHISTLING SWANS,"such a ruckus of noise, God is surely listening"
WHISTLING SWANS,and understanding.
WHISTLING SWANS,"Rumi said, There is no proof of the soul."
WHISTLING SWANS,But isn’t the return of spring and how it
WHISTLING SWANS,springs up in our hearts a pretty good hint?
WHISTLING SWANS,"Yes, I know, God’s silence never breaks, but is"
WHISTLING SWANS,that really a problem?
WHISTLING SWANS,"There are thousands of voices, after all."
WHISTLING SWANS,"And furthermore, don’t you imagine (I just suggest it)"
WHISTLING SWANS,that the swans know about as much as we do about
WHISTLING SWANS,the whole business?
WHISTLING SWANS,"So listen to them and watch them, singing as they fly."
WHISTLING SWANS,Take from it what you can.
WHITE FLOWERS,Last night
WHITE FLOWERS,in the fields
WHITE FLOWERS,I lay down in the darkness
WHITE FLOWERS,"to think about death,"
WHITE FLOWERS,"but instead I fell asleep,"
WHITE FLOWERS,as if in a vast and sloping room
WHITE FLOWERS,filled with those white flowers
WHITE FLOWERS,"that open all summer,"
WHITE FLOWERS,"sticky and untidy,"
WHITE FLOWERS,in the warm fields.
WHITE FLOWERS,When I woke
WHITE FLOWERS,the morning light was just slipping
WHITE FLOWERS,"in front of the stars,"
WHITE FLOWERS,and I was covered
WHITE FLOWERS,with blossoms.
WHITE FLOWERS,I don’t know
WHITE FLOWERS,how it happened—
WHITE FLOWERS,I don’t know
WHITE FLOWERS,if my body went diving down
WHITE FLOWERS,under the sugary vines
WHITE FLOWERS,in some sleep-sharpened affinity
WHITE FLOWERS,"with the depths, or whether"
WHITE FLOWERS,that green energy
WHITE FLOWERS,rose like a wave
WHITE FLOWERS,"and curled over me, claiming me"
WHITE FLOWERS,in its husky arms.
WHITE FLOWERS,"I pushed them away, but I didn’t rise."
WHITE FLOWERS,"Never in my life had I felt so plush,"
WHITE FLOWERS,"or so slippery,"
WHITE FLOWERS,or so resplendently empty.
WHITE FLOWERS,Never in my life
WHITE FLOWERS,had I felt myself so near
WHITE FLOWERS,that porous line
WHITE FLOWERS,where my own body was done with
WHITE FLOWERS,and the roots and the stems and the flowers
WHITE FLOWERS,began.
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"Hello, sun in my face."
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"Hello, you who make the morning"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,and spread it over the fields
WHY I WAKE EARLY,and into the faces of the tulips
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"and the nodding morning glories,"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"and into the windows of, even, the"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,miserable and the crotchety—
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"best preacher that ever was,"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"dear star, that just happens"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,to be where you are in the universe
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"to keep us from ever-darkness,"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"to ease us with warm touching,"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,to hold us in the great hands of light—
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"good morning, good morning, good morning."
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"Watch, now, how I start the day"
WHY I WAKE EARLY,"in happiness, in kindness."
